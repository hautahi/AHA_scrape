Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog!

Posted on June 30, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Claire Ronkartz, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s a classic medical board question: “A two-year old visiting her grandparents’ is found with some blood pressure pills.  What is the best first step managing this patient?” Though I’ve answered this questions many times on tests, I was still at a loss when it really happened!  My two year-old had discovered some luggage with unsecured medication inside, and was mouthing one when we came upon her. So I called Poison Control (stop reading now and write down this number: 1-800-222-1222). They advised a trip to the Emergency Department, where our girl drank an activated charcoal mix, was watched for some hours, and we went home. Although we thought we had meticulously placed all medications out of reach, in locked containers, accidents still happen.  So when your child begins crawling (or even after!), it’s a good time to think about child-proofing.  From button batteries to cosmetics and talcum powder, a young adult’s first “grown-up” house, when they have kids, can be a house-of-horrors for youngsters.  The newest hazard is laundry-detergent pods. Designed for ease of use by adults, these tasty-looking, colorful gems can burn mouths and throats and eyes, causing vomiting and breathing difficulty. Do they have to make them look so good to eat? The best way to toddler-proof your house is to be a toddler.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl through every square-inch of your house.  Open every cabinet and drawer you can reach, and put every single thing you find in your mouth.  If you don’t dare eat what you grab, it needs to be somewhere safer.  Then from your hands and knees, look up. What’s above you that looks attractive, or even just mildly fun to play with? Find something to climb on- a kitchen step-stool, chair, or ottoman.  Can you push it over and crawl up within reach of what you see?  Grab the boiling pot.  Eat the medication sitting on the counter.  Absurd as this sounds, if it can be done, a toddler has already done so in the past, and will in the future.  Make sure it’s not your’s. Now that you’ve done a decent job of making home safe for your little one, you may feel adventurous and head out for vacation, or maybe just Wal-Mart.  One such trip to the store nearly ended in tragedy for me.  My child launched herself out of the shopping cart in the one second it took to reach for some salad dressing.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed her as she tumbled out head-first!  From then on she was seated and belted in the cart. While that’s not as fun as shopping cart surfing, it may save a trip to the the ER. Going out with toddlers poses a new set of risks than your home.  Perhaps most important when you are out is safety around cars, moving or parked. Every week in the U.S., at least 50 children are backed over in driveways and parking lots. LIttle ones who dart outside to say goodbye often go unseen by a driver when the vehicle is set in motion. Many times the driver is a parent, relative, or neighbor. Following a few simple tips can protect your family from this tragedy.  Teach children that parked cars may move at any time.  Let them know that even if they see the vehicle, the driver may not see them.  Always hold a child’s hand in the parking lot. Teach them never to play in, around, or especially behind any vehicle.  Be especially vigilant when someone else is leaving the house and driving away.  Outside house doors should be toddler-proofed. The world of baby safety can be overwhelming.  And now manufacturers prey on your fears, offering lots of products- toilet bowl locks, outlet plugs, stove knob covers, baby gates, etc.  While some of these items may be helpful, doing the simple things we’ve discussed above goes a long way.  The last thing to do is be prepared for an emergency: post or put in your phone the Poison Control number (again, 1-800-222-1222).  Take a CPR/Heimlich class.  Read the books.  Know the location of your nearest child-capable ER.  And for goodness sake don’t buy those stupid detergent pods. Posted in Poisoning Prevention | Leave a reply Is Anything Really Toddler-proof? Posted on April 7, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Asma Khan, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. 9 pm: a frantic call from my sister. She was in the kitchen warming a bottle for her infant, went back into the kids’ room, and found her 2 year-old daughter with her purse. Diet pills were scattered about and a half chewed one in the girl’s mouth.  Though the daughter wasn’t showing any signs of distress, my sister sure was!  She wailed through the phone, “What do I do?” This is a classic accidental ingestion, and a serious concern for parents.  In the 1970′s, the Consumer Product Safety Commission mandated that medicines be sold in child-resistant packaging. This requirement has saved countless lives.  Also in the past 50 years the advent of Poison Control Centers has reduced deaths among children who get into medicines. Fast forward to now, we still see children in the Emergency Department with ingestions. In 2014, the 55 U.S. Poison Control Centers provided telephone guidance for nearly 2.2 million people, mostly for children under age six.  Many more come to the ER. This begs the question: why, with “child-proof” containers, are kids still getting into these things? One big reason is the proliferation of medicines in households.  Many adults are on 2 or more prescription medications, and most also have over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol and cold relievers.  Parents try to store them in high cabinets, but they sometimes miss pills in purses or left on counter tops.  Adults who are sick or have sick children may keep medicine close at hand to be convenient for the next dose.  Abundant medicine within reach becomes a field day for curious toddlers. How can parents prevent children from ingesting these things?  First, pick a safe storage spot that kids can’t see or reach.  Know that any medicine or vitamin can cause harm, even those without a prescription.  Put medicines away after every use- never leave them on a kitchen counter or child’s bedside table- children sometimes try to help parents by taking the medicine themselves. Putting medicines in high cabinets is often not enough.  I know one ex-toddler named Brian who would go exploring in the middle of the night.  Once at 2 am his mom heard noises from the kitchen and found him standing on the counter (having pushed the stool over as a ladder), and was getting a hammer out of the cabinet above the refrigerator. Knowing Brian’s abilities, his father installed hook-and-eye latches on the house doors so he couldn’t get out.  Some nights later the parents heard more noises and found him wandering outside anyway.  He had used a broom handle to push the latch up, and out he went!  Soon all the cabinets in the house had locks, and the door latches had spring-loaded catches that couldn’t be jimmied from below. Like we discussed above, toddlers sometimes get into medicines and accidentally poison themselves, despite having those medicines in high cabinets.  Many children have super-toddler abilities like Brian. F ortunately, most medicines have safety caps that click to tell you they’re closed safely.  Some are so toddler-resistant that adults have a hard time getting them open- this is good!  But sometimes adults have so many pills, and have such a hard time with child-proof caps, that they put their medicines in a weekly pill organizer. These are NOT toddler-proof, and should be treated with EXTREME CAUTION with kids around. Never tell kids that medicine is candy to get them to take it. Instead, explain that taking medicine is for feeling better. If kids are told it’s candy, and then they see grandma taking “candy” from her pill organizer, where to you think they’ll go next? Sometimes we have guests in our homes, especially during holidays. There’s hustle and bustle, and lots of curious, exploring kids.  Discuss medication safety with your guests. Help them keep purses, bags, and coats with medications out of reach. Finally, before you find yourself in a toddler-ingestion situation, be prepared with Poison Control’s phone number handy.  It’s 1-800-222-1222.  Put that in your house and cell phone.  Before you run to the ED, they can advise about whether you need to go in, call 911, or not worry. Take care with household medicines and kids.  Because nothing is really toddler-proof. Posted in Poisoning Prevention | Leave a reply He Ate What??? Posted on January 5, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply One of my most dramatic cases recently started like this:  The police were called to the home for a domestic dispute between drunken parents.  When they arrived, they found a home littered with liquor bottles, trash, and pills.  They also found a three year-old girl unconscious and unresponsive on the floor.   Paramedics were called. When the child came in the ED, she was breathing and her vital signs were stable, but she would not wake up.  We drew blood samples, put in a catheter for a urine sample, pinched her and called out her name, and not a peep.  Everyone assumed she drank from one of the liquor bottles or took a narcotic pill from the floor, but all those tests came back negative.  The police rounded up and brought in all the prescription drugs in the house- eight total- from the parents and grandparents.  I called poison control and they ran all those drugs in their database.  Four of the family’s meds could account for the girl’s stupor.  She was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for observation.  We all wondered when and if she would wake up. If you are a parent or grandparent of a toddler or soon-to-be-toddler, now is the time to poison-proof your house.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl around at the toddler’s level.  Open all the drawers and cabinets to see what poisons they can get to.  Pull on all furniture to see what TVs or lamps will tumble on your (and their!) head.  Then clear all the dangers: put locks on cabinets or put all poisons out of reach, secure all falling hazards. All of that, however, will only get you so far to keeping your toddler safe.  As all parents know, toddlers can be fast, stealthy, and wily.  How many times have I heard a parent sob: “I only turned my back for a second, and he was so fast!”  To stay ahead of a toddler, you must think like a toddler.  When your little one watches you cook and grab ingredients from the high cabinets, they learn that is where the food is.  So they will pull the kitchen stool over, climb up, and try what is up there. When you tell them their medicine is candy, and then they see grannie take her pill, they want grannie’s candy too.  In to the weekly pill holders they’ll go.  At parties, you drink out of a red plastic cup.  Then later, when you drain your lawn mower’s gasoline into a red plastic cup and set that down within reach, it must be something worth drinking, right? Therefore, to beat your toddler, you must go the extra step- poisons and pills hidden and out of reach of even footstools they can use.  Toddler-proof workshops and car ports too.  Don’t tell them medicine is candy to get them to take it.  You can’t watch them every second of every day, so give yourself the biggest margin-for-error, the biggest lead time on them you can. Finally, if they do get into something they shouldn’t, call Poison Control first: 1-800 222-1222.  Get Poison Control stickers and put them on all phones; put the number in the contacts in your cell.  The Poison Control Tech can tell you what to do and where to go.  They will tell you NOT to give your child something to drink, NOT to make them vomit.  They will tell you if you need to flush eyes and skin with running water. Sometimes they will tell you to stay home, like when you call because your child drank shampoo.  They will tell you if you need to see a doctor, but can come calmly.  They will tell you if you need to call 911, and then they will talk to the paramedics and the recieving Emergency Department about what to expect. So get to work on that child-proofing right now!  That goes for you too, Grandma and Granddad!

Kids get a lot of bloody noses. While they’re usually only a mild inconvenience, nosebleeds freak out some parents.  They get alarmed at the blood- it looks like a lot! However, kids rarely lose a worrisome amount of blood. Another myth about kid nosebleeds: they are caused by high blood pressure, and are a harbinger of complications like stroke.  Finally, kids don’t choke to death on blood trickling down their throats. Many nosebleeds seen in the Emergency Department are from minor injuries- bumps on the nose from balls and siblings, and nose picking.  Nosebleeds also happen in dry climates, because of allergies and colds, and because of some medications.  While dry climate is not a Louisiana issue, air-conditioning removes humidity, causing dryness indoors.  However, allergies are common here, and with that comes allergy medication. Allergies make for runny noses, then allergy medicines dry out the nose and mucus.  The dried-out inside of the nose and mucus get cracked, a crack runs through a vein, and pow! Regardless of cause, the initial treatment for nosebleeds is the same.  Apply pressure to stop bleeding and allow clotting.  Applying pressure means gently pinching the nostrils together without causing pain.  We have all been told growing up to lean the head back. This does very little to stop the bleeding, but very effectively causes blood to drain down the back of the throat.  While saving her shirt from blood stains, for the kid it only leads to gagging and coughing and nausea. Gently squeeze the nostrils closed for ten minutes.  It takes that long to make a clot. Don’t keep checking to see if the bleeding is done during that time: letting go interrupts the clotting process.  Hold for the whole time, watching a clock.  Sometimes when parents let go and bleeding continues, they really get nervous.  Don’t panic!  Again, no kids bleed to death from nosebleeds. Close the nostrils for another ten minutes and hang on. Sometimes a few drops of Afrin help slow bleeding. Injuries cause lots of nosebleeds, besides dry noses and allergies that we discussed above.  Misplaced elbows, thrown toys, a wall that leaps in your child’s way, all these cause bloody noses.  Then there’s many children’s favorite pasttime- picking (many adults enjoy this too).  Nose picking is a double whammy on nose tissue.  It often starts with itchy noses from allergy and dry air. Then when your kid scratches that itch, his fingernail tears the already dried out, cracked, and fragile tissue, nicks a vein, and it’s off to the races. Like we said, stopping nosebleeds is usually easy.  Squeeze the nostrils closed gently for ten minutes, not letting go to check if it’s stopped until time is up.  If that doesn’t work, do it again.  But what if after all that your kid’s nose is still bleeding and you’re out of decorative dishtowels, and your furniture and carpet look like a Jackson Pollock nightmare? If the bleeding won’t stop after a couple of tries at direct pressure, then it may be time to bring your child in.  Another issue is if an injury caused the bleeding, should the nose be looked at for other problems besides the bleeding itself?  If there is a large amount of swelling around the bridge of the nose, or every time you touch your kid’s nose they pull away and let out a howl, then maybe it should be looked at. After a nosebleed, there are often some “aftershocks” of bleeding.  If nosebleeds are recurrent you might put a humidifier in the bedroom, and run the air conditioning less.  If bleeding continues on and off for more than a week, it’s time to see an Ear/Nose/Throat (ENT) specialist.  Sometimes kids get a raw spot inside their noses that just won’t heal, and the ENTs have the tiny scopes to look inside, find the raw spot, and cauterize it. All in all nosebleeds are a side effect of growing up.  They are rarely dangerous, and cause more alarm than real trouble.  Remember not to panic, and you can always call the people who are trained to help when you are concerned. Posted in Nosebleeds | Leave a reply Do Nosebleeds Really Come From Cheap Seats At The Cajundome? Posted on July 24, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Adam Giddings, a second-year resident in Family Practice at the LSU-University Health Center program here in Lafayette . Seeing your child with a nosebleed can be a very traumatic image.  While it may appear that he or she is losing a gallon of bright red blood, a nosebleed is often harmless and easily controlled. Nosebleeds may occur periodically in your child’s life.  They can happen at any age, but are most common in children ages 2-10.  After reading this article you should be confident in your ability to handle nosebleeds at home and know the warning signs to see a doctor. Cause of Nosebleeds There are several possibilities why your child has a nosebleed.  Here are the most common causes: - Dry Climate: When your child is exposed to dry air, whether indoors or outdoors, this causes the inside of the nose to dry out.  The dry air leads to cracking in the nose, and those cracks can go through a blood vessel and cause a bleed. - Common Cold & Allergies: If your child has a cold, the lining of the nose may get irritated and bleed, especially after repeat blowing of the nose.  If your child has allergies and is using antihistamines or decongestants to control symptoms, these may further dry the nose and lead to bleeding. - Nose Injury: Another common reason for a nosebleed are injuries.  A blow to the nose may cause bleeding; however, this usually isn’t a concern as long as the bleeding stops in 10 minutes. Treatment of Nosebleeds Although it may initially be scary for both you and the child, there is no need to panic.  Follow these tips for stopping a nosebleed. -Use soft tissues or a damp cloth to catch the blood.  Do not let your child blow their nose, as it may cause more bleeding. -Have your child sit up and lean forward.  Sitting forward will help prevent any gagging on blood going from the back of the nose to the throat.  Myth buster: children do not choke to death on dried blood in the throat.  Gagging on blood and nose bleeds during sleep are no fun, but not life-threatening. -Pinch the nostrils closed just below the bony center to stop bleeding.  With steady but gentle pressure, the bleeding should stop in 5 to 10 minutes.  You don’t have to pinch so hard it hurts.  Steady pressure means don’t continually let go and check if the bleeding is stopped.  Keep the pinch on for the whole 5 minutes, without interruption! -To prevent re-bleeding, do not allow any nose picking or blowing for several hours after. When to seek Medical Attention -If bleeding continues after a third or fourth attempt to stop it, you may want to see a doctor.  Life-threatening bleeding almost never happens, but no one wants to walk around with a bleeding nose either. -See a doctor if your child starts to feel dizzy or light-headed, has a fast heartbeat, is coughing up or vomiting blood, or has a fever. -If your child has nosebleeds frequently- more than once per month- or has been having them for years, see your doctor.  Your child may have a raw spot that just won’t heal, and need an Ears/Nose/Throat specialist to cauterize that bad patch.  Your kid may also need blood tests to be sure he does not have a rare disorder with making blood clots, like hemophilia. Preventing Nosebleeds Although it may be hard to always prevent a nosebleed, below are some simple steps to insure your child doesn’t have them a lot. -When your child is blowing her nose, make sure she is blowing gently. -Teach you child to keep the mouth open when sneezing. -Like we said above, dry air makes bleeding easier.  Air-conditioning dries the air, and the colder it is, the drier.  Turn your A/C more towards 75 degrees, rather than below 70.  Cold winter air is drying, indoors and out, especially at night.  A vaporizer or humidifier at your kid’s bedside can provide moisture to keep the inside of the nose from cracking and bleeding.  A lubricant or saline drops may also be helpful. Remember, it is important to stay calm, as most nosebleeds can be managed at home with the simple steps above.  An occasional nose bleed is not worrisome, and there’s no need to panic.  Now you know what to do!

Forever seared into my memory is the image of my friend, running down the dock at summer camp, his body engulfed in flames.  Behind him trailed burning footprints, lighting his path in the night.  All boys are fascinated by fire, and at age 14 we discovered that aerosol bug spray was flammable, and would briefly burn on your skin without causing injury.  This led to the scene of my friend, doused in flaming insect repellent, running down the dock to jump in the lake.  Luckily he survived the ordeal unharmed, minus some hairs on his head and eyebrows. Many children, though not as foolish as we were, are not as lucky either.  According to National Institutes of Health (NIH) statistics, a quarter of all burns treated in the U.S. involve kids under age 16.  While teenage foolishness may be unavoidable, burns are largely preventable.  The incidence of burns, and most importantly severe burns, has decreased in recent decades.  This is due to improved building codes, education in schools about fire escape planning, and smoke detectors.  Yet burns do still occur, and fortunately most of these are minor. As a medical student I spent time on a burn ward, and saw many different types and severities of burns.  One thing that stood out for me was the disproportionate number of young children admitted for burns.  According to the NIH, most pediatric burns happen to kids under age 5.  Most of these are scald injuries, and occur in the kitchen.  And given that we adults are in charge of the kitchen, these are avoidable. Preventing burns includes common sense things like keeping small children out of the kitchen while cooking.  Don’t carry children and hot food at the same time.  Advice that might seem less obvious: turn the pot handles on the stove inward, so they don’t stick out where kids can grab them.  Make sure appliance cords don’t hang over counters either, for the same reason- curious children grab stuff, and if that stuff is hot toasters or pots full of boiling soup, disaster can ensue. Several times in the past in this blog, Dr. Hamilton has mentioned that most of the burns he sees are when little kids take hot bowls of noodles out of microwaves.  Someone else happens along, bumps that big, in-the-way microwave door, and the bowl spills on the child.  In my time as a medical student on the burn ward, I also saw a lot of kids burned when they pulled on a tablecloth that had a container of hot liquid on top. As we mentioned above, kitchen burns can be prevented with a little extra care.  Small children should be kept out of the kitchen while hot food is being prepared, and should never operate microwave ovens without an adult hovering.  Pot handles and electric cords should be out of reach. After age 5, burns happen more with open flames.  This includes campfires and bonfires, and fireworks.  Open fires should be contained within fire pits, with no flammables (extra wood, long dry grasses) close by.  Kids shouldn’t wear loose flowing clothing near fire, or clothes that easily catch fire with a spark (synthetics).  And though it seems obvious (to the sober), don’t throw lighter fluid or gasoline on open flames.  We see too many kids who get engulfed when those fluids become an exploding cloud. Though we do our best to prevent children from harming themselves, burns happen. Fortunately the vast majority do not require seeing a doctor.  Small burns can be managed at home by remembering the 5 C’s.  Clothing- immediately remove any clothing involved, so that the hot liquid or flaming clothes don’t continue to burn. Cooling- cool water stops the burning process, and feels good too!  Cleaning- soap and water is sufficient, to minimize infection if the skin barrier is compromised.  Cover- put on antibiotic ointment generously and cover with gauze.  This also soothes, and prevents infection. Comfort- pain relief with Tylenol or ibuprofen. When should kids see a doctor for burns?  Burns that blister, or are larger than the area of the patient’s hand, or involve faces or joints, should get seen.  Kids should have up-to-date tetanus vaccines, since burns increase the risk of tetanus infection. Posted in burns | Leave a reply Ouch That’s Hot! Posted on September 20, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Matthew Whittington, a third year resident in the Family Practice program at the University Health Center here in Lafayette.  We see a lot of burns in the Pediatric Emergency Department, mostly from spilled hot liquids or kids grabbing hot curling irons or open ovens.  And parents feel terribly guilty when it happens.  Read and heed Dr. Whittington!- SH The idea of a child getting burned is such a scary subject for parents.  Though it is scary, educating yourself now is the best way to prevent a burn.  You also will know how to best handle a burn situation if it happens.  If a parent has a sound game plan, a frightening situation can be countered with calm quick action. Prevention is the best way to handle burns, of course.  A weekend project to ready you and your home can go a very long way for peace of mind.  Cover electrical outlets.  Exploratory behavior of young children often leads to them sticking fingers, coins, forks, and keys into these outlets.  Set the water heater to 120 degrees (or less).  Always check the water temperature of running water for baths. Keep flammable materials, like curtains, at least three feet away from space heaters and candles.  Hide the matches and lighters so they are never in a child’s reach.  Install safety gates around fireplaces.  Install smoke detectors in every bedroom, in main hallways, and everywhere else recommended in the smoke detector instruction booklet.  Watch closely while using appliances that heat up, like curling irons and hair dryers. Burns commonly happen in the kitchen.  Never hold a child while cooking at the stove. Use high chairs in the kitchen to keep your toddler from reaching hot things, or install gates to keep them out of the kitchen.  Only use back stove burners, with pot handles turned inwards.   Toddlers will reach up and grab pots, just like mom does!   Be very careful with the microwave.  Children often get burned when they are allowed to heat things up in the microwave themselves.  Microwave doors also are big targets for others to bump into when hot things are being taken out, and the hot liquid gets spilled on everyone nearby. However, if burns occur despite your best prevention measures, appropriate care is essential.  Care of burns depends on what type of burn you are dealing with.  First degree burns affect only the outer layer of the skin.  They are red, and can be slightly swollen. Sunburns are the most common first degree burns.  This type of burn can still be quite painful.  Run cool, clean water over the affected area to halt the burning process.  Do not use ice as this can further damage the skin.  Mild burn creams and ibuprofen or Tylenol can help with the pain. Worse burns are second and third degree burns.  Second degree burns are when the skin is burned through more than one layer, the skin layers separate with the damage, and blisters form.  Second degree burns are still painful, because the burn does not destroy the nerves.  Third degree burns cook the full thickness of the skin.  The burn area tends to be pale/yellow, and leathery.  They often do not hurt to touch, given that the nerves are damaged. If dealing with burns beyond minor first degree, still cool the burn with clean water. Remove all jewelry, clothing, bracelets, and rings.  These might constrict the burn area when swelling sets in.  Taking clothes soaked with hot scalding liquid off right away will also help keep the burn from progressing from a first degree burn to worse. If blisters have formed, don’t pop them!  This increases the risk of infection.  Cover the area with a dressing, preferably one that won’t stick.  If nothing else is available, you can use cling wrap.  This acts like a second skin to prevent infection later.  Then bring the child to a doctor. Most importantly, begin talking with your children about hot items and fires.  Start at an early age so they always know the importance of safety measures.  With prevention and education, your home can be happy and safe.

Posted on January 15, 2016 by klfydoctor 3 This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Seth Koster, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Is your child ”bouncing off the walls” or “just won’t listen?”  Pediatricians and family physicians see lots of kids with behavior problems.  Parents or teachers often want to know if this is ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or just bad behavior? ADHD is a hot topic.  Some claim that ADHD is only bad behavior from ineffective parenting- “she just needs a good spanking!”‘  On the other extreme, some kids receive ADHD medication who don’t need it. Regardless if you believe ADHD is real, here are tips on helping kids act better.  Kids who don’t have ADHD respond to these tips; kids who do may respond less consistently, but will still be happier and better behaved. Spanking? Many ask, to spank or not to spank?  A bigger question is why are you spanking?  If you do spank your child, avoid doing this in anger.  Only spank for behavior that’s dangerous, like running into the street, not for something small. Explain why you’re punishing. He may not understand right away, but kids get more than you think and will eventually catch on. More importantly, reward good behavior.  Positive reinforcement is MUCH more effective than punishment.  Saying things like “Thank you for being so quiet,” and “You did a good job picking up your room” is great behavior modification. Every kid (and adult!) likes praise, and kids will work to earn more. Don’t be sarcastic, or make fun of your child. Young children are sensitive, and cutting remarks and mean-spirited teasing hurt feelings.  Pre-teens and teens don’t like that either.  If you are unpleasant to your children, they will grow up thinking that it’s okay to be abused and to abuse others Build family traditions. Many households lack structure or traditions.  Do something together!  Go to a park or to church every Sunday, or have Friday night pizza as a family. Kids look forward to these things- it’s something to do with mom and dad. Also keep extended family in mind and make time for them. Keep a home routine, or “rhythm.”  Chaotic homes make chaotic children.  Some kids who seem to have ADHD just aren’t used to having to sit still and follow along; they never learned how at home.  We know it’s especially important to have a routine home life for children with autism or ADHD, but every kid behaves better and is happier with structure. Keep the same bedtimes.  Don’t let kids stay up later with phones or watching TV-that’s cheating!  Eat meals together at regular times. Give your children daily and weekly chores. Even kids as young as 5 years-old want to help, and should start picking up after themselves.  Be realistic though; the seven year old shouldn’t be shingling the roof.  5-6 year-olds can clean rooms, 8-9 year-olds can help with dishes and take out trash, and 13 year-olds can mow lawns and babysit younger siblings for short periods. Expect your children to RESPECT others. Respecting adults and peers is important. The Golden Rule, “Treat people as you want to be treated,” even very young children understand.  This is the South- we expect ”yes sir” and “no ma’am.”  Doing this will help your kids earn respect in turn. Set a good example by respecting others in speech and action.  Your child should never hear you curse.  If (or when?) you do mess up, be honest with your children and tell them you expect better from yourself, and them. Don’t argue with your kids, or ask them “why” they did something. If they misbehave, punish them appropriately and briefly explanation why they acted badly.  Asking them why makes it personal, as if they are bad inside and not just simply making a mistake.  If they argue with your reasoning, don’t engage them in the argument.  As Dr. Hamilton used to say to his kids, “This isn’t an argument, this is simply how you should act.” The most challenging child can benefit from these tips. Try them out; if you don’t make progress with difficult behavior, you’re not alone!  Talk with your doctor or school counselor.  They can help you with behavior techniques, to help your kids be the best they can be.

Kitchens can be dangerous, particularly for kids.  Ovens and stoves stand ready to burn little hands.  Microwaves produce boiling liquids to spill.  There’s broken glass, raw meat, sharp knives, poisonous powders and liquids under the sink, blenders and garbage disposals.  Since parents spend lots of time preparing meals and kids want to be around them and everyone is getting something from the refrigerator, it’s a high-traffic area where collisions happen.  Watch Chopped and note how chefs warn each other when passing; they know it’s dangerous bumping each other with pans of hot oil. Yet kitchens are places for families to get together.  Ideally, parents and kids meet there at breakfast, and discuss what-happened-today at dinner. Parents can monitor their kids’ homework at the counter.  Also, kids want to help with food prep- if weren’t entertaining, they wouldn’t have cooking shows!  Kids want to learn skills like chopping and baking. And of course, they want to eat! It’s important then to teach food safety.  First is frequent hand-washing.  Most illnesses are contracted from hand-to-hand contact. In the kitchen hands are touching raw meat, dirty vegetables, raw eggs, which can carry illness-inducing bacteria.  And people are always touching their faces and licking their fingers, putting those germs into their bodies.  Everyone should be washing hands after handling raw foods, before forgetting and inadvertently infecting themselves. Kids should learn to wash dirty utensils and cutting boards too.  Keeping clean in places like the kitchen and surgery is like a kid’s game, where the bad guys (bacteria and viruses) are invisible, and you have to work a certain way to not get contaminated. Change or wash knives after cutting raw meat or vegetables.  Use only plastic cutting boards for meat- bacteria-laden meat juice soaks into wooden boards and stays. I use my microwave a lot, but I hate others having them.  Sounds selfish, but the most common kitchen injury I see is kids burned when taking food out of the microwave. Usually mom is in another room; the child heats soup or noodles, opens the microwave’s big clumsy door, and someone bumps into it.  Screaming and blistering burns ensue.  If the child gets splashed on the face or hands it can be disfiguring. Kitchen safety is something that is taught- kids aren’t born knowing ovens are hot, microwave doors are big targets, and dishwasher pods aren’t edible.  My mom loved to tell the story about my genius brother who, when she explained that the red stove was dangerous, he had to touch it for himself.  Yow! After modeling kitchen cleanliness like above, next show kids how not to get hurt. Teach about the dangers of hot liquids, stoves, and ovens, and those damn microwave doors. If you have a gas stove, kids need to learn not to turn them on unknowingly, and about fire hazard.  People often store poisons under the sink- cleansers, dishwasher detergent, rat poison.  Dishwasher pods look particularly appetizing. If you have babies and toddlers, install toddler-proof locks on the cabinet doors.  Even better, put those things high and out of reach. Kids want to handle knives.  They should learn basic rules like always cutting away from themselves, and not holding food being cut in their other hand. Knives should be used slowly and carefully- no hurry when slicing!  Leave the high-speed dicing to the cooking shows. Finally, supervise kids when using blenders, garbage disposals, and snow-cone makers. It’s a life-long disability when kids lose fingers by reaching in these machines while they’re running. Everyone needs to learn how to cook and to be safe in the kitchen.  We all learned cooking from our parents, and I’m proud of my son when he makes gumbos and stews, or when my daughters bake a cake.  It’s a joy to be together in the kitchen.  But teach them not to get Chopped.

Some called her the “world’s worst mom,” and child protection agencies took note.  Others praised her for not being afraid to give her child freedoms not allowed by  “helicopter parents,” so-called because they hover over their kids’ every move.  Ms. Skenazy recently completed a reality TV series where she coached such parents on letting their kids ride bikes or slice vegetables, to give the kids some independence.  The show’s title: World’s Worst Mom. In the Pediatric Emergency Department, we often roll our eyes at what some kids are allowed to do- ride 4-wheelers or use the microwave.  But we only see the kids who get hurt; scads of kids use microwaves without spilling boiling water on themselves, and jump on trampolines without breaking something.  The key is teaching children to do these things safely. Before Ms. Skenazy let her 9 year-old ride the subway alone, she had coached him on reading subway maps and identifying uptown versus downtown trains.  It’s the same with kids doing any risky thing, like riding bikes or 4-wheelers.  There’s rules and training before setting your kid loose. Of course, learning to ride a bike requires teaching; kids can’t just get on and ride.  But the safety stuff requires more parenting- teaching the rules of the road and enforcing helmet use.  When my son wanted to ride to his friend’s house miles away, we went riding together to show how to stay on the right side of the road and cross busy streets safely, and to be sure he knew the way.  And we had him call when he arrived so we could relax. When I was eight years-old, they built a hospital near my house.  Construction sites are as good as Disneyworld to a child: piles of dirt to play on, and those big yellow machines!  Fortunately the workers took the keys out of the bulldozer; otherwise we would have fired it up and gone for a spin. One day I ran across the site and into a mud patch.  It was deep enough that I sank to my knees, stuck.  Remembering the quick-sand scenario in movies, I was scared that I might sink more.  I yelled to my buddy, but he stood helplessly at the edge of the patch, no rope or stick handy to save me.  Since no other rescue was likely, I decided I had to save myself and began to slog my way to a big rock nearby.  Three or four heaves in that direction and I was able to hug the rock and haul myself out. Parents worry about letting their kids out into the world.  If my folks had known about that deep mud, would they have let me go to the site?  Perhaps not, but back then things seemed safer.  There wasn’t 24-hour cable news, needing to fill a whole day with attention-grabbing stories to scare parents.  Every child abduction in the country now gets breathless attention.  Before cable and internet there were only brief TV news programs and newspapers; no space to report every child tragedy in the nation. In reality, back then children were actually less safe.  Crime was rising in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1993.  Now there is 50% less crime than when I was a kid.  In addition to a more dangerous environment, kids went out without cell phones or bike helmets.  So the world turns out to be pretty safe for kids; the odds that your kid will be kidnapped or seriously hurt are very tiny. And children yearn for freedom.  They want to explore, push boundaries, and be proud of their accomplishments.  Lenore Skenazy’s boy was beside himself with joy at going home alone on the New York subway.  While many think that’s extreme, even the FAA lets 14 year-olds fly gliders solo.  Makes a bike ride across town seem pretty tame. Posted in ATV safety , Bike and Trampoline Safety , Play time | Leave a reply The Running Of The Bulls Posted on April 24, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply I was checking out The Running of the Bulls on the internet yesterday.  If you haven’t heard, that’s a festival in Pamplona, Spain where they set bulls loose in the streets of the city. Thrill-seekers get chased by the bulls, and every year the news shows someone getting gored by a bull’s horns and/or stomped on.  I found one site titled, “Running of the Bulls with Families,” and did a double-take.  They let kids run with the bulls too??!! Fortunately, that website said children aren’t allowed in the streets when the bulls run, and discussed how families can reserve a balcony to see the fun.  It reminded me of our own Louisiana version of Running of The Bulls with Families which I call “Letting Kids Drive ATVs.” ATVs (or 4-wheelers) and bulls have lots in common.  They are both over-powered.  Like bulls, ATVs are designed to go off road and pull farm wagons.  That requires a lot of power, too much for young children to handle.  Also like bulls, ATVs are difficult to control.  ATVs have high centers of gravity and go fast, making them easy to roll over.  They require hand-eye coordination and anticipation of hazards that children don’t have, which is why we don’t let kids drive cars before age 15. And yet many parents put their children on ATVs anyway.  They even make 4-wheelers for kids!  I have treated ATV drivers as young as 5 years old in the Emergency Department.  It boggles the mind that these parents don’t see the potential for injuries.  Kids fly off them and hit their heads, sometimes sustaining severe brain injuries.  Kids roll the things, the heavy machine tumbling over the child, maybe causing organ rupture and internal bleeding.  Kids zip past trees and posts, smashing hands and ankles, knees and elbows.  Children who lose control sometimes run over their friends. I have seen all these injuries in all degrees of severity. I have seen ATVs put children in the Operating Room and in Intensive Care.  I have warned in this blog, in the newspaper, and on TV about letting kids drive them.  Yet some parents can’t stop from indulging their children with 4-wheelers, no matter what experts say. In fact, Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) seems to have given up cautioning against putting kids on ATVs, and instead has posted recommendations for “safe” ATV operation for kids.  As I list these recommendations, it feels like giving children safety instructions on smoking cigarettes (“Hey kids, be sure to smoke only filter tips!”). The first tip on the CPSC fact sheet is to stay off paved roads.  ATVs are for off-road.  They go too fast, get harder to control, and are easier to roll over on pavement.  Also, roads are where the cars and truck are, and I’ve seen too many kids crash into the bigger, faster moving vehicles.  Another tip: never allow children younger than 16 on adult ATVs.  The CPSC states that more than 90% of child ATV injuries happen when they drive adult machines, given kids’ lack of size and developmental skills.  Thus companies make ”age-appropriate youth models.”  (Maybe It’s time cigarette companies come out with age-appropriate youth models too).  To be fair, the kid models have adjustable speed limiters, making it harder to go unsafe speeds.  Please keep the adjuster to a safe setting! Kids (and adults) should wear helmets, goggles, gloves, long pants and sleeves, and over-the-ankle boots.  Going off road means tree branches, fence posts, and rocks, so wearing that stuff makes good sense.  Allow only one rider on single-rider ATVs.  Safe operation of ATVs requires the driver to be able to shift weight freely and a passsenger gets in the way, increasing the risk of roll-over or other crashes. Finally, if you must let your child drive an ATV, get them training!  Deaths and injuries happen when inexperienced drivers lose control, get thrown, roll over, or run into things.  Hands-on training can help your kid avoid bad situations.  FInd a course at the ATV Safety Institute, the ATV dealer, or the National 4-H Council. Even better, save lots of money and heartache by getting your kid a really good bicycle instead. Posted in ATV safety | Leave a reply Deadly Machines Posted on July 3, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply The parents got our attention by banging on the Ambulance Entrance doors.  In their panic they had stopped there and did not read the signs about the walk-in entrance.  They were panicking for good reason. The father had his three-year old daughter in his arms.  Her hair was matted with dry and fresh blood, her face was gray, and she was limp.  Her eyes were half-open and lifeless. “Her cousin lost control and ran her over with the 4-wheeler.”  This, unfortunately, is an all too common story.  We piled into the trauma room- monitors on, IVs going in, stethoscopes on chest, hands feeling all body parts for injuries.  Within a minute it was clear that the girl had only a  head injury, but a bad one.  She was breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive.  She had only a few deep cuts on her scalp to account for all the blood- with most head injuries the real problem is much deeper.  In a few minutes we would take her to the CT scanner to look at her brain. The parents clung to each other in a corner of the trauma room, tears streaming down their faces.  As we talked about what was happening, the rest of the story came out.  The cousin driving the 4-wheeler was twelve years old and had just gotten it for his birthday.  His parents thought it was safe because the 4-wheeler was a “kid-sized” one.  We bundled the IV pump, portable monitor, and oxygen tank onto the trauma bed and wheeled off to CT. The CT revealed multiple skull fractures, brain bleeding, and brain swelling.  After we finished stabilizing her, off she went to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit under the care of the neurosurgeon and pediatric intensive care doctor.  I tried to be optimistic with the parents, but that was hard because the true possibilities were not good.  The child died two days later. For generations in Louisiana and other farming states, children and teenagers have had to help out on the farm.  It is almost impossible to manage without letting the kids run the farm machines.  The invention of the ATV, particularly the 4-wheeler, gave rise to a cheap, easy-to-operate vehicle for farming and hunting.  Their affordability, ease-to-drive, and power naturally lead to their use for recreation. The drawback to 4-wheelers is their instability.  They are top-heavy and overpowered.  Their drivability lead inexperienced operators (like children, or teenagers with their inherent immature judgement) to lose control.  The drivers either roll them over and get injured when the heavy machine rolls on top of them, or the drivers run over playmates. There is a good reason that we do not routinely let kids younger than sixteen drive cars.  The hand-eye coordination to operate heavy, powerful vehicles and the maturity to choose to be safe are not developed yet.  The twelve year old in our story above was having fun that he thought was care-free.  However, toys should not be gas-powered. Every once in a while, especially when I see a 4-wheeler snorting along side the road, driven by a kid, often with another kid on back, I think of that morning in the trauma room.  I get angry, or sad, as I think of the guilt that the twelve-year old boy and his parents have to live with, or the pain of the girl’s parents.

Posted on June 30, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Claire Ronkartz, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s a classic medical board question: “A two-year old visiting her grandparents’ is found with some blood pressure pills.  What is the best first step managing this patient?” Though I’ve answered this questions many times on tests, I was still at a loss when it really happened!  My two year-old had discovered some luggage with unsecured medication inside, and was mouthing one when we came upon her. So I called Poison Control (stop reading now and write down this number: 1-800-222-1222). They advised a trip to the Emergency Department, where our girl drank an activated charcoal mix, was watched for some hours, and we went home. Although we thought we had meticulously placed all medications out of reach, in locked containers, accidents still happen.  So when your child begins crawling (or even after!), it’s a good time to think about child-proofing.  From button batteries to cosmetics and talcum powder, a young adult’s first “grown-up” house, when they have kids, can be a house-of-horrors for youngsters.  The newest hazard is laundry-detergent pods. Designed for ease of use by adults, these tasty-looking, colorful gems can burn mouths and throats and eyes, causing vomiting and breathing difficulty. Do they have to make them look so good to eat? The best way to toddler-proof your house is to be a toddler.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl through every square-inch of your house.  Open every cabinet and drawer you can reach, and put every single thing you find in your mouth.  If you don’t dare eat what you grab, it needs to be somewhere safer.  Then from your hands and knees, look up. What’s above you that looks attractive, or even just mildly fun to play with? Find something to climb on- a kitchen step-stool, chair, or ottoman.  Can you push it over and crawl up within reach of what you see?  Grab the boiling pot.  Eat the medication sitting on the counter.  Absurd as this sounds, if it can be done, a toddler has already done so in the past, and will in the future.  Make sure it’s not your’s. Now that you’ve done a decent job of making home safe for your little one, you may feel adventurous and head out for vacation, or maybe just Wal-Mart.  One such trip to the store nearly ended in tragedy for me.  My child launched herself out of the shopping cart in the one second it took to reach for some salad dressing.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed her as she tumbled out head-first!  From then on she was seated and belted in the cart. While that’s not as fun as shopping cart surfing, it may save a trip to the the ER. Going out with toddlers poses a new set of risks than your home.  Perhaps most important when you are out is safety around cars, moving or parked. Every week in the U.S., at least 50 children are backed over in driveways and parking lots. LIttle ones who dart outside to say goodbye often go unseen by a driver when the vehicle is set in motion. Many times the driver is a parent, relative, or neighbor. Following a few simple tips can protect your family from this tragedy.  Teach children that parked cars may move at any time.  Let them know that even if they see the vehicle, the driver may not see them.  Always hold a child’s hand in the parking lot. Teach them never to play in, around, or especially behind any vehicle.  Be especially vigilant when someone else is leaving the house and driving away.  Outside house doors should be toddler-proofed. The world of baby safety can be overwhelming.  And now manufacturers prey on your fears, offering lots of products- toilet bowl locks, outlet plugs, stove knob covers, baby gates, etc.  While some of these items may be helpful, doing the simple things we’ve discussed above goes a long way.  The last thing to do is be prepared for an emergency: post or put in your phone the Poison Control number (again, 1-800-222-1222).  Take a CPR/Heimlich class.  Read the books.  Know the location of your nearest child-capable ER.  And for goodness sake don’t buy those stupid detergent pods. Posted in Poisoning Prevention | Leave a reply Hospitals Are Cool Posted on June 9, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply I think hospitals are cool.  When I was a kid and went to visit someone, I was impressed by the big, maze-like structures, mysterious things going on inside.  The halls were full of strange smells, odd noises, futuristic equipment.  When I got older and entered the profession myself, they became my work home, magnificent buildings dedicated to researching and combating illness and death. Many have the opposite feeling- they hate hospitals.  When I meet friends occasionally at work, I’ll see them twitch and glance about.  ”What’s wrong?” I’ll ask. “Hospitals give me the willies,” they’ll say, looking as if they expect the mummy or Frankenstein monster to pop out of, say, the Radiology suite. I see their point.  Hospitals are places where people go when they’re suffering. You hear moans of pain from rooms, overhead calls for “Code Trauma” and “Code Blue,” and staff talking gravely in hushed tones.  Hospitals are also easy places to get lost in. They grow organically.  Is there a new specialty and technology? Throw up a new wing over here. Need more beds?  Stick an annex there.  They’re maze-like not to purposely confuse outsiders; that’s just how they evolve. Hospitals are certainly safer than in the past.  They’re no longer places where people regularly catch infections, or get the wrong limb sawn off. Initiatives in the last decades have made medicine as safety-conscious as aviation. Checklists, safety-training, and protocols have erased much of the haphazardness of medicine.  Patient safety is now as much of staff education as drawing blood or using the computer. You can help make your kid’s hospital stay safer too.  First, choose a hospital that’s appropriate for kids.  Some hospitals take care of lots of kids, some don’t.  Second, choose an academic hospital- one that’s affiliated with a medical school and trains medical students and residents.  Statistically, patients at teaching hospitals do better- have more accurate diagnoses, go home sooner, and generally get better care.  There is something about that environment, where multiple doctors at various levels of training put their heads together, discuss cases, teach each other, that helps them figure out what’s wrong. In the Emergency Department at Lafayette General, I occasionally interact with one bunch of those doctor teams, the surgeons.  Surgery teams are an odd bunch.  Busy, harassed by nurses and non-surgeons like me, they bustle around in packs of five or six. They come in all sizes, levels of training, and stages of grooming; tall, short, medical students, residents, some with hair and scrubs rumpled like they’re just out of bed, some coiffed and wearing clean, starched lab coats.  Their boss is the Attending, the surgery professor who breezes into patient rooms with authority and bon vivant, reassuring all that they’ve got it managed, their minions scribbling down orders in their wake.  Not the pretty picture seen on Grey’s Anatomy. LIke we discussed above, being a patient in “academic” institutions like Lafayette General or University Hospital and Clinics has advantages.  Patients get better quicker when they have more than one doctor puzzling over their cases, discussing it with each other, researching together.  However, keeping all those doctors straight can be tough for patients, and parents.  Which doctor is which specialist, responsible for which issue? It’s always a good idea for a patient to have an “advocate.”  Best if this person has some medical knowledge, and can keep everything straight.  Usually pediatric patients come with an advocate already- their parents.  However, parents are also emotionally involved with their child’s case, worried sick.  Already overwhelmed, often the parent needs a cool-headed advocate themselves. There’s a lot for a patient, parent, and advocate to keep straight, besides which doctor is responsible for what.  There are multiple medications and tests.  Where are we with the diagnosis, what’s the treatment plan?  And did you wash your hands before touching my child? These are important things to monitor.  Even with computer-controlled drug dispensing, you still want to ensure that your child is getting the right medication and the right dose. The radiology tech comes to pick up your child for xrays- ask why this test, what will we learn from it? So after you and your pediatrician pick your hospital, and your child must stay, have an advocate to help you navigate the complexities of medical care.  And to keep all those characters in scrubs straight. Posted in Surviving Hospital Stays | Leave a reply Real Animals Are Not Cartoons Posted on June 2, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Crystal Davis, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child. Posted in Animal Bites , Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply Drama In Real Life Posted on May 19, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply April 29th was a bad day in Lafayette.  Around midnight at Festival Internationale, two people began arguing.  Possibly fueled by alcohol, the fight escalated, someone pulled a gun, and one person ended up dead, and two injured by stray shots. Interpersonal drama brings many kids to the Emergency Department too, particularly teenagers. Someone says the wrong thing, feelings are hurt, punches are exchanged, and we see the ensuing facial and head injuries.  Teens are particularly vulnerable to these escalations.  Already at an emotional age, with hormones surging, feelings are raw and easily chafed. Teens are also often in the early stages of learning conflict resolution. They are unskilled in managing feelings and arguments without resorting to shouting and violence. Several outside forces can inhibit teens from maturing into rational adults too.  A lot of media these days portrays immature behavior as something fun to watch and emulate. Reality TV consists of knuckleheads gossiping about each other on camera, making wars out of simple disagreements.  Then the assailants confront each other and scream obscenities for the enjoyment of the TV audience.  And the combatants are always so good-looking, just like teens want to be. Social media amplifies drama as well.  When I see fights brewing at festivals, it’s not just two teens having a tiff.  There’s usually a crowd of “friends” swirling around, egging them on, joining the shouting.  With social media, the crowd is even bigger, with unlimited gawkers available through screens and sites, taking sides, trading barbs. Simple arguments become electronically-enabled riots. Some teens learn poor conflict resolution at home too.  When some parents fight, their negotiating skills look like the Jerry Springer show. Rather than a calm discussion of differences, these parents try to intentionally hurt the other’s feelings, verbally “aiming to kill,” instead of speaking respectfully.  When kids grow up living with such behavior, they rarely learn a better way for themselves. Like we discussed above, social media can fuel conflicts between people.  Once on Facebook, I saw a picture of a friend’s teenage son at a party.  His round smiling face, his arms draped around two friends, reminded me of actor Jonah Hill  (a cute Jonah Hill, not the overweight creep he sometimes portrays). So, bonehead that I can be, I said so in a comment. The backlash from he and his parents, and my wife, still makes me cringe with embarrassment. Thus one problem with social media: it’s easier to commit a social faux pas with a keyboard.  When you’re face to face with a person, you naturally edit what you say, to not offend.  There’s non-verbal cues that help you to not say dreadful things. This in-person behavioral check doesn’t operate when interacting online. Secondly, when you’re angry at another person, this social media disconnect makes it easier to intentionally wound.  In World War II, fighter pilots were rarely troubled by killing their enemies, though viciously machine-gunning each other in one-on-one combat.  This was because they concentrated on the other plane, not the pilot inside. Likewise today, it’s easier to say the meanest thing that comes to mind online, because you’re saying it to a machine. But screens are like fighter planes- there’s a real person hidden inside that gets hurt. So how can you counter the forces of Reality TV and on-line depersonalization, that turn your teen into a screaming drama king or queen?  Begin before your child’s a teen. In pre-teen years, games should be played less on screens, and more face-to-face. Board and card games, tag and backyard ball, are all conflict-resolution exercises for kids. Negotiating the rules, playing fair, keeping friends, all happen in those arenas, not in video games. You must also model good behavior yourself.  Parents should have arguments that aren’t death matches, but calm settlings of differences. Feeling wronged and needing vengeance are innate human traits- show your kids how you bypass those cruder motivations, to stay friendly. Finally, texting and messaging are certainly convenient, but elementary school kids should spend more time together in person than on screens. Phone and computer time should be limited, like limiting how much candy kids eat. And explain that there’s real people on the other side of the screen, not computer-generated enemies.  Then it’s easier to avoid comparing someone to Jonah Hill. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Explosive Babies Posted on May 5, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days! Posted in Diarrhea , Vomiting | Leave a reply Throw Like a Girl Posted on April 6, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Corey Gardner, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “You can’t beat me!” yelled Jacob, the ringleader of the third-grade boys who controlled the playground at recess.  He was yelling at me, the scrawny little thing in the ankle-length blue dress with flowers on it. “Oh yes she can, and she will, even in that dress,” countered my friend Reggie.  I stood silently, waiting for the race to start.  Reggie and I had played lots of tag and touch football, he knew my speed, and that no dress would hamper it.  With the distance marked and the rules set, we lined up.  ”Go!”  I took off, blue skirt streaming behind me like a sail. Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. Posted in Play time , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply High Anxiety Posted on March 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My son’s transcript showed he had failed Business Law, a bad start for a kid considering applying to law school for…business law.  After emailing his professor to ask the particulars, he stumbled through the day in a haze of misery.  When he found himself enjoying something- a joke or nice weather, the happiness was quickly extinguished by the thought, “I’ve failed.”  One big worry: how was he going to explain this in a law school interview? Later that afternoon his professor replied- it was just a mistake. My son’s final exam grade had not been entered into the system yet, which triggered the fail mark.  It would be fixed, and my son breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  But it took some time to shake that feeling of dread that haunted him for half the day.  Anxiety can be sticky. Many teens, and elementary school kids too, are plagued by anxiety.  There’s school- worry about grades, fear of bullying, tense relations with teachers.  Home can make a kid anxious too- divorce, yelling, sometimes abuse. Many kids have concerns about their neighborhood- they have to live with the threat of crime, violence, and drug dealers on the corner.  Finally, kids see the news too, and worry about the world.  They hear stories about environmental collapse, threat of deadly epidemics, and the possibility of nuclear armageddon. We are born with the tendency to be anxious.  Anxiety is a motivator cultivated by evolution, keeping us from getting eaten.  Worried about that sabre-toothed tiger eyeing you?  Good, run away!  Even animals as primitive as lizards have anxiety.  Just approach one, watch it twitch and scuttle about, before tearing off. Some kids and adults are better at handling anxiety than others.  And many kids have manifestations of anxiety that look like illness.  That’s when we see them in the Emergency Department.  Sometimes the signs in kids are subtle- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue.  Sometimes they have more concerning symptoms, like chest pain or fainting. And occasionally we see true panic attacks. When I was in high school, worried about getting grades good enough to be a doctor, I failed a french test.  The big red “F” on the paper burned into my brain at first period. But it wasn’t until fifth period that I became shaky, broke out in sweat, and was led sobbing to the nurse.  She called my parents to admonish them about putting too much pressure on me.  My mom replied, “It’s not us!  The stupid doctor thing is all his idea!” Anxiety can make kids short of breath, and thus parents bring them to the Emergency Department. Some are just hyperventilating, but kids with asthma can have true attacks triggered by anxiety.  In fact, in the mid-twentieth century, when medicine was full of freudian theory, many thought asthma was a psychological disorder.  Even in the face of real wheezing, the noise was attributed to patients’ “suppressed cries for help”- wheezing was those cries fighting to get out. Fortunately, asthma is now recognized as true disease. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a panic attack and medical emergencies like asthma.  Both kids have trouble breathing.  Both complain about chest pain and tightness.  And whether their shortness of breath is due to airway narrowing or panic, either kid looks anxious!  Occasionally it can be tough for even doctors to tell panic attacks and asthma apart, despite stethoscopes and oxygen monitoring. How do we manage anxiety?  Kids handle anxiety differently.  Some aren’t bothered by stress, those proverbial ducks letting worries roll off their backs like water.  But some need help.  Counseling can help kids tell the difference between true medical problems like headaches and stomachaches, and those symptoms being triggered by worry. Many don’t recognize when they’re having anxiety, and knowing if you’re anxious, and why, is a big step in coping with it. Counselors can also help kids identify management strategies.  For some, exercise helps “burn off” anxiety.  For others it’s prayer, meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques.  A few kids need medication, to temporarily get them through rough patches as they learn to cope. If you think your child is anxious, talk to them about their feelings, and maybe see their doctor to explore it more.  You want to do that before worry becomes panic attacks, and needing to come see me. Posted in Anxiety | Leave a reply Sore Throats Hurt! Posted on March 10, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chris Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in  Lafayette. Dreaded words at 7 pm on Friday night: “Mommy, Daddy, my throat hurts.”  Doctor’s closed, nowhere to turn.  It’s a common complaint, especially in my house with three girls. You’ve had sore throats yourself, and know-they hurt! Pharyngitis- doctor talk for throat inflammation- accounts for about 12 million office and ER visits yearly.  Pharyngitis has two main causes- viral (about 85% of cases), and bacterial (about 15%).  Many viruses cause sore throats, like adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza (“the flu”).  The most common bacteria is Group A Streptococcus, a.k.a. Strep Throat. It’s hard to tell the difference between strep and viral pharyngitis.  Besides throat pain, both cause headache, fever, and fatigue.  However, viruses tend to have more cough and runny nose.  But having those doesn’t exclude strep! There’s a few rules for doctors to separate the two.  First, strep throat happens mostly after age 3- red throats in babies and toddlers are rarely bacterial.  Second, if the child has a fine-bumpy, sand-papery rash on the trunk and face, that’s the “scarlet fever” of strep. The most important rule is that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it’s tough to differentiate the two without a strep test. The test is a throat swab that indicates if strep bacteria is present. It’s a good test, but not perfect, catching about 85% of strep throats.  Thus your doctor must weigh the symptoms, the exam, AND the strep test to decide if your child has strep.  If it’s strep, he needs an antibiotic.  If it’s viral, antibiotics don’t kill viruses. This is the kicker for parents.  Sore throats hurt, and everyone wants them gone. Many want antibiotics, thinking they will help.  But they won’t stop viruses, and we don’t give unnecessary antibiotics for good reasons.  Antibiotics have side effects- yeast infections, stomach upset, and possibly allergic reactions.  Most importantly, when your body is exposed to antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotics, and when you do need them to fight that bacteria, they won’t work. We’ve all had throat pain, and it’s miserable.  Dr. Hamilton tells of having yearly sore throats as a teenager.  When he got them, he remembers praying for the pain to go, counting the days of misery, and vowing to never again take feeling good for granted! Like we mentioned above, there’s no cure for viral sore throats.  The virus must run it’s course, typically 2 to 4 days.  If it’s a bacterial strep throat, which again is the minority of cases, only then will an antibiotic help.  So how to treat those viral illnesses that your child must “ride out?” Dr. Hamilton doesn’t remember taking medicine for his sore throats, besides throat sprays and lozenges.  And often when we see kids in the Emergency Department, parents haven’t given anything for pain either.  For your child’s sake, please do! There’s two medicines for pain and fever, perfectly safe for kids: Acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).  These come in many forms and flavors to make them easier for kids to take- liquids, chewable tabs; and for toddlers who spit out medicine instead of swallowing, acetaminophen rectal suppositories. No prescription necessary. Many parents, afraid to overdose their kids, don’t give enough medicine for the pain or fever.  Again, it’s quite safe to give what’s advised on the box for your child’s age or weight.  Still unsure?  Call your doctor’s office to double-check dosing. Give lots of fluids to help your kid feel better.  She may not eat much, and that’s okay. Fluids are more important, and she’s not going to starve in a few days.  If she does want food, light meals are best, like grits, oatmeal, or soup.  Popsicles and ice cream can soothe throats too. Keep your child out of school or daycare- don’t let them spread the illness to others. They won’t feel like learning anyway.  If your child has strep, they must stay out of school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, since it’s highly contagious. If your kid keeps getting strep after strep infection, your doctor can refer him to an ENT surgeon for tonsillectomy.  For the vast majority of sore throats though, 2 to 4 days and things will pass.  Push fluids, give pain medicine, and don’t take feeling good for granted again. Posted in Sore throat | Leave a reply Training Dogs and Toddlers Posted on February 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My feisty little poodle, Milou, is all dog.  He’ll fetch endlessly, race around the yard chasing squirrels, and occasionally catch one in a lightning-fast wrestling match. Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog! Posted in Spanking , Talking to Babies and Toddlers , Time-outs | Leave a reply Rashes- The Home Triage Posted on February 9, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Justin Pratt, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Post navigation ← Previous Next → Drama In Real Life Posted on May 19, 2017 by klfydoctor April 29th was a bad day in Lafayette.  Around midnight at Festival Internationale, two people began arguing.  Possibly fueled by alcohol, the fight escalated, someone pulled a gun, and one person ended up dead, and two injured by stray shots. Interpersonal drama brings many kids to the Emergency Department too, particularly teenagers. Someone says the wrong thing, feelings are hurt, punches are exchanged, and we see the ensuing facial and head injuries.  Teens are particularly vulnerable to these escalations.  Already at an emotional age, with hormones surging, feelings are raw and easily chafed. Teens are also often in the early stages of learning conflict resolution. They are unskilled in managing feelings and arguments without resorting to shouting and violence. Several outside forces can inhibit teens from maturing into rational adults too.  A lot of media these days portrays immature behavior as something fun to watch and emulate. Reality TV consists of knuckleheads gossiping about each other on camera, making wars out of simple disagreements.  Then the assailants confront each other and scream obscenities for the enjoyment of the TV audience.  And the combatants are always so good-looking, just like teens want to be. Social media amplifies drama as well.  When I see fights brewing at festivals, it’s not just two teens having a tiff.  There’s usually a crowd of “friends” swirling around, egging them on, joining the shouting.  With social media, the crowd is even bigger, with unlimited gawkers available through screens and sites, taking sides, trading barbs. Simple arguments become electronically-enabled riots. Some teens learn poor conflict resolution at home too.  When some parents fight, their negotiating skills look like the Jerry Springer show. Rather than a calm discussion of differences, these parents try to intentionally hurt the other’s feelings, verbally “aiming to kill,” instead of speaking respectfully.  When kids grow up living with such behavior, they rarely learn a better way for themselves. Like we discussed above, social media can fuel conflicts between people.  Once on Facebook, I saw a picture of a friend’s teenage son at a party.  His round smiling face, his arms draped around two friends, reminded me of actor Jonah Hill  (a cute Jonah Hill, not the overweight creep he sometimes portrays). So, bonehead that I can be, I said so in a comment. The backlash from he and his parents, and my wife, still makes me cringe with embarrassment. Thus one problem with social media: it’s easier to commit a social faux pas with a keyboard.  When you’re face to face with a person, you naturally edit what you say, to not offend.  There’s non-verbal cues that help you to not say dreadful things. This in-person behavioral check doesn’t operate when interacting online. Secondly, when you’re angry at another person, this social media disconnect makes it easier to intentionally wound.  In World War II, fighter pilots were rarely troubled by killing their enemies, though viciously machine-gunning each other in one-on-one combat.  This was because they concentrated on the other plane, not the pilot inside. Likewise today, it’s easier to say the meanest thing that comes to mind online, because you’re saying it to a machine. But screens are like fighter planes- there’s a real person hidden inside that gets hurt. So how can you counter the forces of Reality TV and on-line depersonalization, that turn your teen into a screaming drama king or queen?  Begin before your child’s a teen. In pre-teen years, games should be played less on screens, and more face-to-face. Board and card games, tag and backyard ball, are all conflict-resolution exercises for kids. Negotiating the rules, playing fair, keeping friends, all happen in those arenas, not in video games. You must also model good behavior yourself.  Parents should have arguments that aren’t death matches, but calm settlings of differences. Feeling wronged and needing vengeance are innate human traits- show your kids how you bypass those cruder motivations, to stay friendly. Finally, texting and messaging are certainly convenient, but elementary school kids should spend more time together in person than on screens. Phone and computer time should be limited, like limiting how much candy kids eat. And explain that there’s real people on the other side of the screen, not computer-generated enemies.  Then it’s easier to avoid comparing someone to Jonah Hill.

Posted on September 7, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply We all know kids bore easily.  All summer if the kids are not occupied with camps, vacations, or friends, they lay about complaining of nothing to do.  Believe it or not, children also get bored during a disaster. Of course the aftermath of a hurricane (our most common disaster in Louisiana) is exciting at first.  Down power lines and trees to avoid.  House and yard turned upside down and maybe damaged.  Flashlights, lanterns, and cooking on gas stoves (“Its like going camping, hurray!”).  After a day or two without school or power, without easy access to friends because of road blockages, things get boring quickly.  Even worse, there is no TV or video games.  There is no air-conditioning.  Water and food may be running short. Nothing makes a bad disaster worse than a kid who is whining about being bored and hot, thirsty and hungry.  You will want to be ready for your children to weather a disaster as well as yourself. The first order of business is survival and comfort.  Have plenty of bottled water and non-refrigerated food.  Have lanterns, flashlights, and enough batteries.  Have a gas cooking source.  Without A/C, battery-operated fans are a god-send to keep kids cool.  You will also want to have wash water (fill those tubs!), bug spray, pain medicines, and a first aid kit to keep children comfortable when they are hot and sweaty, bug-bit and scratched up. Next, you will want to keep those busy little brains happy.  Make a trip to the library when you go to stock up on supplies before a storm.  Get them reading now, so that it will be more automatic for the kids to curl up with a book when they need to be occupied, quiet, and out of the way.  Have board games and card games ready.  Get them to ”test” the games before the disaster, so they will know what games they will like when the power goes.  Have them make themselves an exercise plan to burn off energy- laps around the house, playing tag, safe ball games, push ups, jumping jacks, and the like. As you might have gathered from the above, it is easier for you and more fun for the kids to get them involved in their own disaster “survival.”  Have them make their own lists and kits for home survival or travelling to safety.  They can help set up their own food, water, books, games, lights, bedding, clothes, shoes, and fans.  Have them help you shop for the things they will need. If you and your kids are well-prepared, maybe the next hurricane will become a fun time for them like camping, rather than a trauma and disaster.  Do you have a story or idea about keeping kids happy during a disaster?  Put it in the comments below!

Now, some people swear by their favorite cough medicine.  “Works every time!” they crow about their Robitussin or Dimetapp.  However, what is working is the Placebo effect, a psychological trick where if you believe in the medicine, it seems to work.  When you test the medicine in a blinded study, where you can’t tell the medicine from a dummy fluid, patients report no difference between the medicine and the dummy.  In 2007 scientists tested honey against dextromethorphan (the “best” of the cold remedy ingredients).  Guess who won- honey! Most prescription cough and cold medicines are no better.  Most of these are anti-allergy medicines, and if your cold is from a virus instead of an allergy, good luck.  The only prescription that has been shown to really help for coughs is codeine, and that really only for dry, hacky coughs.  And you can’t give codeine to a kid under 3 years-old. So next time your child gets a cold, try the things I talk about in the “Cold in Babies” category.  Don’t ever smoke in the house.  And feel free to try your favorite grandma remedy- chicken soup, honey, lemon.  Just please leave out the whisky!

Posted on May 29, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Michelle Taylor, a family practice resident at University Health Center here in Lafayette. 2 year-old Lily was playing around the pool.  You go to move her from the edge and grab her hand.  She slips in a puddle and her arm gets tugged.  She bursts into tears and now keeps her arm at her side and doesn’t move it.  Now you’re crying too: “What did I do to my baby?  Did I break her arm?” Thankfully, you didn’t.  Lily has what’s called a “Nursemaid’s elbow.”  Nursemaid’s elbow is a common injury of early childhood, in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. What exactly happens?  You have two bones in your forearm, the radius and the ulna. They lie side by side and their upper ends are part of your elbow joint. Those ends are bound together by a ligament, like a rubber band holding two sticks together.  In some kids that ligament is weak and the radius end slips out when tugged. Actions that cause a Nursemaid’s elbow include 1) jerking a child by the wrist.  Even something as minor as pulling a child’s arm through a sleeve can cause the radial head to slip. 2) Pulling a child up by the hands.  Lifting a child under the armpits is safest. 3) Swinging a child around by the arms.  While lots of kids love this, save it for when they are older than 4 years.  4) Falling over.  Sometimes if a baby is sitting up and flops over on her side, her arm can be pinned under her so that the radial head clicks out. How do you know if your child has a Nursemaid’s elbow?  First of course, the arm is tugged like above.  When it happens, the parents usually feel a pop in the child’s arm, often in the wrist.  Since they are holding the wrist, they think that’s where the injury is. However, the pop happens in the elbow and the parent feels the pop transmitted down the child’s radius to the wrist. The child cries at the time of dislocation, but often settles down and acts fine as long as the elbow doesn’t move.  He will walk around with his arm hanging by his side.  Only when he forgets and tries to use that elbow will he whimper.  There is no swelling. How do you know if the elbow is broken, not just a Nursemaid’s elbow like above? Let’s change Lily’s story from above.  Instead of having her arm tugged, say she was running around the pool, slipped, and fell on her elbow.  She cries and cries and doesn’t settle down and the elbow swells.  Then it may be cracked. Sometimes with toddlers, we don’t know how they got hurt.  Say Lily was playing in her room with 3 year-old cousin Elliot.  You hear a cry and Lily comes running out holding her arm.  Did Elliot pull on the arm and cause a nursemaid’s elbow, or did she fall off the bed and break it?  Elliot and Lily can’t say- they don’t have the words yet . Those cases we have to x-ray.  Broken elbows are often swollen because the crack in the bone bleeds within the joint, but not always!  If we don’t have a clear story that the child’s elbow was only pulled on and not fallen on, a cracked bone is possible.  Broken elbows need to be casted so that they will hold still for the month or two it takes for the bone to heal. However, if it is a nursemaid’s elbow with a clear story of the arm simply being pulled on, no casting or xrays are necessary- the doctor fixes it right away. We have the child sit on mom’s lap, perform a gentle twisting and flexing maneuver, and feel the radius pop back in place.  The child cries, but usually settles down and within 5 minutes is using the arm normally. You are not a bad parent if your child has a nursemaid’s elbow.  You can’t know if your child has loose ligaments in the elbows until it happens.  Kids who get it may get it again- those ligaments don’t tighten up until age 4 or 5.  Remember to avoid tugging your child’s arm or swinging them around.  And if that elbow pops out again, bring them in and we’ll pop it right back.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Breaking Poverty’s Chain The Magic Bullet for Poverty Posted on July 13, 2009 by klfydoctor 3 I see a lot of impoverished families in the Pediatric Emergency Department.  At least a couple of times per week I see a bright-eyed, curious child who has the potential to become a success.  The child smiles, plays, looks around curiously at all the new and interesting things.  As my mom would say, “she has a light bulb inside!”  Then I look over at the child’s mom- she is a teenager, harried, tired, dressed in a dirty t-shirt and sweat pants.  The mom opens her mouth and out comes street slang and curses.  I think: “What chance does this child have to get out of the cycle of poverty?  Will she be trapped like the generations before her?  Is this mom equipped to do what it takes to teach this girl better than she was taught?” The science on breaking out of poverty is clear: words, reading, and education.  The more words a child hears in infancy and toddler years, the more a child is read to, the better the child’s later reading skills and love of learning.  A love of learning leads to school success, which leads to better jobs and a release from the poverty of previous generations.  The famous pediatric neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson, wrote about his mom who could not read beyond the third grade level.  Yet she would make her two boys read two library books each week and submit written reports to her.  The Carson boys developed a love of learning which took them out of the Detroit ghetto, to college, and eventual success in business and medicine. The start of a child’s road to success is words.  Kids need to hear a lot of words, and a lot of different words.  They need to hear conversations, be spoken to, and hear reading.  How the words are said is important too.  Positive talk helps kids grow to be future winners.  Positive things to say: “You are smart.  Good job!  Thank you.”  Saying negative things hurts a child’s chances to grow up smart, things like “Sit down!  Shut up!  Be still!”  Many parents are scared that if they are not using tough, disciplinary talk, the child will grow up lazy and soft.  However, children need time to wiggle, explore, and be loud.  Negative talk can also be turned into positive talk: “Please sit down.  Thank you for being quiet for a bit- mommy needs to hear this.”  Again, the science is clear- successful adults heard four times as much positive talk as negative when they were kids. Reading to a child is important.  Parents should make the reading fun for their kids and themselves- using silly voices and animal noises, stopping to look at the pictures and talk about them, talking about what is happening in the book.  As the child learns to read, a parent should let her take over the work of reading and read to the parent.  Kids love to show off- they should have a chance to be proud of themselves and their new abilities. Using positive words and reading to children is not always easy.  Being patient and kind when a kid is acting badly is the hard work of parenting.  Reading to kids when the parent is tired and just wants to drop in bed herself is hard work.  However, this is the hard work that will bring a better life for a child.  Ask Ben Carson’s mom.  She worked two and three jobs at a time to support her boys, but it was the extra time she spent watching their reading that really paid off in the end.

Posted on July 14, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply Kids get headaches too, even as young as two and three years old!  But when many parents first hear their child complaining about head pain, they freak out and head for the Emergency Department.  When there is a headache, we all worry about the bad stuff- brain tumors, meningitis, and aneurysms and strokes. Most headaches in kids are not bad.  Usually they are from the same things that give adults headaches- stress and  cold viruses.  Certain other infections can cause headaches too- strep throat, walking pneumonia, stomach viruses, and other viruses too. Kids also get migraine headaches.  These are headaches that are very painful, sometimes cause vomiting, and make every day living (school work, play) hard.  Migraines often come regularly.  Some people have them once a month, some once a week, some more often than that.   If you think your child has migraines, definitely bring him or her to your doctor to talk about headache treatment and control. All parents worry that the headaches are something bad, like a brain tumor.  So when do you need to bring your child to the Emergency Department?  Warning signs of a more serious problem are headaches that wake children up at night, children who act more and more lethargic with their headaches, and headaches with fever and stiff neck. As always, if you don’t know where to go to start with your child’s headache, call your doctor.  They should be able to tell you over the phone if the headache can wait until the next available appointment, or if you should go the Emergency Department. So if your child gets a headache, don’t panic!  If he or she is awake and alert, smiling, drinking, talking well, it is okay!  As Arnold Schwarzenegger said in the Kindergarten Cop movie:  “Its not a tumor!” Posted in Headache | Leave a reply Categories Allergies Alternative Medicine Ambulance Calls Animal Bites Antibiotic Usage Anxiety Appropriate ER visits Asthma Care ATV safety Back Pain Back To School Health Bad Behavior Bad News Becoming a doctor Bedwetting Belly Pain/Appendicitis Belly Pain/Constipation Bike and Trampoline Safety Blood Donation Breaking Poverty's Chain burns Cancer in Children Car Safety chest pain Choking Hazards Christmas safety and happiness Cold Medicines Colds in Babies Colic Cost of Medical Care croup Dental Care and Injury Dental infections Depression Diarrhea Disaster Readiness Dog and Cat bites Drowning Prevention Ear Pain Eczema/Dry Skin Education elbow injuries Eye Health and Safety Fainting Fever Fever and Pain Meds Fractures Gun Safety Head Injury Headache Hearing Loss Heat Injury Hives and Poison Ivy Influenza Influenza Insect bites/Boils Insect Stings Kitchen safety Lice and Bedbugs Measles Mosquito bites/illnesses Mumps Music and Medicine Newborn Sleeping Safety Normal Newborns Nosebleeds Nutrition and Obesity or ""The Flu"" Parental Fears Picking a Doctor Picky Eaters Play time Poisoning Prevention Rashes Return to school/daycare recommendations RSV/Bronchiolitis Seizures with fever Sleep Health snakebites Sore throat Spanking Spiders and ticks Sports and Concussion Staying Well Stimulant Use Stitches Sunburn Surviving Hospital Stays Talking to Babies and Toddlers Talking with Teenagers Teen Health Care Teen Pregnancy- How it is bad Teen Vaccines Time-outs Traveling with Children TV Health Uncategorized Vaccines Value of tests Vomiting Proudly powered by WordPress var _gaq = _gaq || [];

Komen Acadiana has awarded two grants to Lafayette General Foundation (LGF) for St. Martin Hospital (SMH) in Breaux Bridge, and University Hospital & Clinics (UHC) in Lafayette, totaling $119,643.00.  The grants from Komen Acadiana to LGF will support screenings, mammograms, patient education and patient navigation services.  The aim of the grant is to impact women who are uninsured or underinsured. The grant for SMH will focus on women over 40 who are in need of a mammogram living in the parishes of Iberia, Lafayette, and St. Martin. Women under 40 will qualify if they have a first-degree family history of breast cancer.  Women with Medicaid and Medicare are eligible under this grant.  The second grant, in favor of UHC, will fund a Nurse Navigator who serves patients from many parishes across Acadiana.  The Nurse Navigator helps patients, who have an abnormality found during screening, to receive the appropriate diagnostics and follow-up treatment.  The Patient Navigator will also assist patients with making or rescheduling appointments and overcoming any obstacles that may prevent them from accessing treatment. A doctor’s order is required. If a patient does not have a physician, help is available. For more information, or to make an appointment, call (337) 507-1209. Mention “Susan G. Komen grant.” “Last year, Lafayette General Foundation was able to secure two grants from Komen Acadiana for $146,798,” said Cian Robinson, Executive Director of LGF.  “Our past success in helping those less fortunate had a lot to do with securing this year’s grant.  I’m thankful for all of the LGH employees that play vital roles in delivering these much needed services.  We are humbled to accept this grant and hopeful to make a difference in our community.” Susan G. Komen is the world’s largest breast cancer organization, and Komen Acadiana is among over one hundred affiliates on the front lines dedicated to ending breast cancer in their communities. Komen affiliates fund innovative breast health programs that provide vitally needed breast cancer screening, medical supplies, financial assistance (including emergency living expenses and insurance co-pays), as well as patient and family support. “At Komen Acadiana, our community needs assessment indicates that access to low-cost mammogram screenings and prompt diagnostic testing for underinsured or non-insured women is an issue,” said Styphanie Duplissey, Grants Manager. “We are confident that through Lafayette General Health, women in our community will be able to receive the care they need, when they need it.” Back to News Listing Main Facilities Lafayette General Medical Center Lafayette General Surgical Hospital Lafayette General Southwest University Hospital & Clinics St. Martin Hospital Acadia General Hospital Abrom Kaplan Memorial Hospital Professional Centers Cancer Center of Acadiana Cyberknife Center of Louisiana Lafayette Behavioral Health Unit Lafayette General Endoscopy Center Lafayette General Imaging Lafayette General Telemedicine Clinics Oil Center Surgical Plaza Urgent Care Centers Services Bariatric Surgery & Medical Weight Loss Cancer Cardiovascular Ear, Nose, and Throat Emergency Medicine Hyperbarics and Wound Care Neuroscience Ophthalmology Plastics and Reconstructive Surgery Orthopedics Pediatrics Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Primary Care Pulmonology Radiology & Imaging Stroke Center Surgery Urology Wellness Women's Health (OB/GYN) Wound Care Lab & Radiology Report Login for Physicians ICD-10-CM-PCS Code Lookup © 2017 Lafayette General Health Site Map | Privacy Policy Healthcare Website design by In10sity (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){

All media is crafted, whether they call it “reality,” or commercials.  Everything on TV, and even in newspapers, is carefully made to catch your attention so that you will believe in it or the products advertised along with it.  I heard Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, lecture once in college.  One of the funniest things he said was “TV is not there to entertain you, it is there to sell you things.”  Spock couldn’t have said it better. The problem is that sometimes media messages go against good health.  TV encourages kids to drink soda and eat fatty, sugary foods.   They in turn get fat and get stomach aches, which brings them to the Emergency Room.  Reality shows  encourage emotional drama and lousy communication, which then encourages emotional drama and lousy communication at home.   The ensuing family fights end up in the Emergency Room with suicides, abuse, and exaggerated pain symptoms. Parents and kids need to be “media literate.”  Figure out for yourself what the TV is trying to tell you or sell you, and discuss that with your kids.  Discuss with them that just because the kids on TV are happy, dancing, and popular because they are drinking delicious soda, that doesn’t mean delicious soda leads to happiness. I listened to my kids from another room while they were watching their reality show.  They began laughing and talking about how stupid the characters were acting, and whether or not the particular bit on the show was staged or spontaneous.  I relaxed and smiled, because I realized they were figuring out for themselves what was really “real.” Posted in TV Health | Leave a reply Categories Allergies Alternative Medicine Ambulance Calls Animal Bites Antibiotic Usage Anxiety Appropriate ER visits Asthma Care ATV safety Back Pain Back To School Health Bad Behavior Bad News Becoming a doctor Bedwetting Belly Pain/Appendicitis Belly Pain/Constipation Bike and Trampoline Safety Blood Donation Breaking Poverty's Chain burns Cancer in Children Car Safety chest pain Choking Hazards Christmas safety and happiness Cold Medicines Colds in Babies Colic Cost of Medical Care croup Dental Care and Injury Dental infections Depression Diarrhea Disaster Readiness Dog and Cat bites Drowning Prevention Ear Pain Eczema/Dry Skin Education elbow injuries Eye Health and Safety Fainting Fever Fever and Pain Meds Fractures Gun Safety Head Injury Headache Hearing Loss Heat Injury Hives and Poison Ivy Influenza Influenza Insect bites/Boils Insect Stings Kitchen safety Lice and Bedbugs Measles Mosquito bites/illnesses Mumps Music and Medicine Newborn Sleeping Safety Normal Newborns Nosebleeds Nutrition and Obesity or ""The Flu"" Parental Fears Picking a Doctor Picky Eaters Play time Poisoning Prevention Rashes Return to school/daycare recommendations RSV/Bronchiolitis Seizures with fever Sleep Health snakebites Sore throat Spanking Spiders and ticks Sports and Concussion Staying Well Stimulant Use Stitches Sunburn Surviving Hospital Stays Talking to Babies and Toddlers Talking with Teenagers Teen Health Care Teen Pregnancy- How it is bad Teen Vaccines Time-outs Traveling with Children TV Health Uncategorized Vaccines Value of tests Vomiting Proudly powered by WordPress var _gaq = _gaq || [];

Posted on November 21, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Allan Olson, a family practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette.  Allan is 61 years old, yet is on the long and stressful road of residency that makes a doctor.  How does he do it?  For one, he takes care of himself with a healthy diet.  And there is no better time to learn to eat right than as a kid.  Read more: How can parents have the biggest effect on their children’s health? Providing a safe environment and promoting physical activity top the list.  However, your guidance with the greatest potential involves something we do every day- eating.  Nutrition is a huge opportunity to help your kids feel good and be well prepared for their day. Furthermore, your food leadership will create habits to insure good health for their whole lives. What foods are best?  Research is showing that whole food, plant-based nutrition provides the maximum benefits for children and adults.  This means a diet consisting of vegetables and fruits and less animal products (meat and dairy).  Avoiding fast food and processed food (any food that comes from a factory) is also important to eat well.  These contain too much fat, sugar, and salt for your body. For many people this will be a major change in the foods they eat, and it is important to say that such changes need not happen overnight.  The key is to begin selecting foods which consist of plant products that have not been fried or processed, frozen or boxed. Start using these foods in your family’s diet, and eventually meet the majority of your meal needs with them. Food choices can influence whether kids develop certain chronic diseases.  Childhood obesity has become much more common, as have diabetes, asthma, and constipation. Studies show most obese childen will become obese adults, and can expect to develop adult diseases early in life, like high blood pressure and heart disease.  In other words, obese kids will live shorter and more miserable lives.  While many factors lead to these diseases, food is among the most important causes, and the most effective cure! Two examples of how diet can influence health and illness:  Many children with constipation are cured when milk is removed from their diet, and fruits and vegetables added.  Some studies show best results when all dairy is stopped.  Know that eating milk and cheese is a matter of choice, not necessity, for children and adults.  We do not absolutely need milk or other dairy in a healthful diet. Asthma provides another example.  Asthma has become very common in children. Asthmatic airways become inflamed, breathing becomes difficult, and kids wheeze.  Often kids with asthma also have allergic runny noses and itchy skin.  These can be treated with medications, but we are finding that in many children they can be prevented with a plant-based diet.  Specifically, the antioxidants in plant foods seem to both prevent and treat the inflammation in allergy and asthma. Now food companies have seized this idea and manufacture foods with added antioxidants, touting them as more healthy.  However, studies suggest that antioxidants in processed-food are much less effective than in whole foods.  It seems the whole food must be eaten to get the health benefits, and that natural foods contain other beneficial components besides the antioxidants. Here are some more hints on diet.  Breakfast really is the most important meal.  Be sure your kids eat it every day, if only some fresh fruit.  Have your kids eat at home as much as possible, at the table with the whole family.  This is an important social time for families, and you can be sure your kids are eating right. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and other canned or bottled drinks.  Even those which are sugar-free and artificially sweetened are not good.  Sugar-free drinks still do not keep off the pounds!  The best drink is water, though some sports drinks are okay for electrolyte replacement while exercising, or if your child is sick with vomiting and diarrhea. Finally, eating should be fun!  Invite your kids to help you plan meals based on plants. Include their ideas in selection and preparation.  Make trying new foods an exciting challenge.  Your children may need to try a particular food a dozen or more times before they like it.  Your choices for their diet will help shape their choices- for life! Posted in Nutrition and Obesity | Leave a reply Green can be good, not just good for you Posted on December 9, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply I grew up in New Jersey, home to many chemical companies.  I remember one day in my fifth grade science class when some food scientists from one of those companies came to visit, and impress us with what magic they could do with chemistry.  One demonstration was giving us a glass of clear green fluid to drink.  We tasted it, agreed it was delicious, but could not place the exact flavor.  It tasted familiar, but not like the lime we expected.  The scientists then revealed the mystery: it was root beer flavored!  We all went, “Oh yeah,” and talked about flavor and color and presentation and expectations. Food scientists have been working then and the decades since to perfect making processed foods delicious.  They use chemicals and processes with such artfulness that now a cake made from a box tastes better than scratch-baked.  However, in their processing in great taste and texture and color, they have processed out something more important: nutrition.  How can green beans compete with potato chips that science has designed to tickle our senses and brains to the max? Nutritionists, pediatricians, and other child advocates have been fighting a losing battle against the food industry.  We say, “eat more fruits and vegetables and wheat fiber, they are better for you.”  However, if people listened and ate only what was good for them, then all the manufacturers of soda, candy, chips, boxed cereal, boxed processed food,  juice drinks, powdered drinks, instant dinners, frozen dinners, fast food, and snack food would be out of business. We have to get smarter than saying “eat healthy” and then forcing McDonald’s to put some apple slices in the Happy Meal.  The only way to make green vegetables able to compete with manufactured foods is to make them as delicious.  We have to saute them in garlic and olive oil, serve them with hummus and other healthy dips, marinate and roast them on the grill, simmer them into home-made soup.  And then we have to encourage our kids to try them.  It takes something like 14 tries for a kid to learn to like something, so we can’t quit after 13 tries.  Then, when a kid begins to like vegetables and other healthy foods, we begin to win the war on obesity and stomach aches. A much fonder memory of my childhood in New Jersey was when my mom would make home-made vegetable soup on cold winter days, delicious and warming after a morning playing in the snow.   That is a better green memory than clear green root beer, and the kind of memory we need to leave our kids to help them stay fit and healthy. Posted in Nutrition and Obesity | Leave a reply Keeping Kids Healthy and Fit, so They Can Be Kids Posted on December 2, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply This past Thanksgiving I spent a day at one of my favorite havens- Boy Scout Camp.  No TV, plenty of outdoor activity for the boys, and limited junk food.  However, this past visit had its disappointments- many of the kids I taught were already obese.  There were kids surfing their iPhones around the campfire.  The Trading Post did brisk business in candy bars and soda. I usually don’t mind the Trading Post or iPhones.  However, most of those kids already have a steady diet of soda, junk food, and electronic entertainment every day of the year.  Goodies that were once a special treat away from home have become the norm at home. This over-consuming of junk food and entertainment leads to other medical problems besides being merely fat and idle.  These kids feel bad about themselves.  They do worse in school.  They fill doctors’ offices and emergency departments with complaints of stomach pain and constipation.  They will grow up to have early heart attacks, depression, diabetes, strokes, gall bladder attacks, cancers, knee and foot pain. Obesity is not entirely our fault.  Humans and other animals were biologically programmed eons ago to eat, store fat, and rest when food was plentiful, as a hedge for when food was scarce.  Now, in our modern society, times are always good when it comes to finding calories.  And biology had no need in the bad old days to provide us with an off switch for eating and resting. Our biological bent to obesity is now also aided and abetted by the food industry.  In the 1950s the industry had a dilemma: how do you convince an already well-fed people to eat more, in order to accelerate profits?  They invented “food science,” where chemists manufacture additives to make food more delicious and more delicious-looking.  They invented advertising based on psychology to sell us that food and get us hooked, like addicts and their first taste of heroin. And it worked.  Who doesn’t love junk food, myself included?  Even in France, where they are famously fussy about their good food, McDonald’s does its biggest business outside of the US.  So how can we save our children from what we have wrought on them?  And what about our planet, which is groaning with the burden of  supporting our junk food habit?  And what of the unfairness, the sin, where billions in the world still go to bed hungry? The answer is that our brains must take charge over our biology.  The hard work starts at home- don’t buy junk food and soda!  Don’t bring it into the house!  Make sure your kid gets a fruit with every meal.  Give them a vegetable with lunch and dinner- if only a handful of carrot sticks (my favorite go-to vegetable).  All grains should be high fiber- whether it is wheat bread or high fiber breakfast cereal.  Dinner should be eaten with all the family members together, talking about their days and their lives, practicing conversation, stimulating each others’ brains,  rather than watching TV. More hard work- be firm with your kids about the TV.  It should not be turned on at all on school days.  Computers should only be used for school work on school days- not for surfing, watching videos, or playing electronic games.  Kids should never have a TV,  computer, or game system in their bedroom. If your kids are bored and whining and start to fight, stay strong!  That boredom is incentive for them to go out and start exploring and making their own fun, which is how kids grow good brains and strong bodies.  That is when they learn to love books, friendships, board and card games, sports, and outdoors.  Soon the no-TV/computer rule becomes easier to enforce. Play is the work of childhood.  It is now harder and harder to protect your childrens’ play from the onslaught of advertising, junk food, and electronics.  But this is part of the hard work of parenting, so your kids can be kids again.

It’s stressful to be sure; it’s supposed to be tough.  Some girls are fainting, some are washing out because they can’t hack it, some stay up too late and lose sleep. Amy has her eyes on the prize- graduating and moving up.  When she gets anxious, she swallows it and moves on. Uncharacteristic for her, she’s eating well and going to bed early.  Her parents are proud, not only for her accomplishment but for how far Amy has come.  Her life wasn’t always this way. From an early age, Amy was having a rough go.  She had trouble paying attention in first grade, though she was highly intelligent.  She angered some teachers with her pointed, seemingly rude commentaries, though other teachers “got” her. She was tried on ADHD medications, which helped for a time, but then began causing side effects where Amy acted confused and panicky.  By high school, it was clear Amy was depressed.  She was sullen, didn’t get along with most of her classmates, and scraped out poor grades. Despite grasping the material, she just didn’t care enough to get papers in on time or study for tests. Amy had no obvious reason for depression.  She had two loving, educated parents and two happy siblings.  At the first sign of trouble with attention or mood, she got the best doctors and therapists.  As Amy got older and was able to verbalize what was going on inside, it seemed her depression was “chemical:”  she was just born that way, with no external reasons like bullying or her looks. Anti-depressant medication helped, as did continued counseling.  Her parents cheered her on through thick and thin, and as she got older Amy’s life began looking up.  College was much better than high school as far as academics and having friends. She had positive dreams for her future.  Joining the Army wasn’t her parents first choice; heck, even with a bachelor’s degree she enlisted rather than take on the responsibility of being an officer. But now they were singing a different tune. Sharon has it much worse than Amy.  I saw Sharon in the Emergency Department last month.  She came by ambulance after being beaten by a gang of boys.  They ran up behind her, knocked her down, and kicked her repeatedly in the head and chest. There had apparently been some bad blood between Sharon’s friends and other factions in the neighborhood. From our computer record I saw that Sharon had had a tough life already, though only 15 years-old. She had been seen by us twice for sexual assaults, another time for being beaten up, and once to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal thoughts. She came from a rough house in a rough neighborhood.  Her mom obviously had mental illness of her own, from the pressured speech of hyperactivity or drug use, to her peculiar tattoos.  Mom yelled a lot, at Sharon and us, though this seemed to be not from anger but how she usually spoke. Certainly Sharon’s depression has not gotten the attention that Amy’s did.  Though she had been in hospital for depression, Sharon isn’t on anti-depressants and isn’t in counseling.  Chaos rules her home life: her father’s gone, and she bounces between mom’s and the homes of several other families. Her school and neighborhood aren’t safe. Despite all this, I have some hope for Sharon.  Kids can be resilient, and Sharon still had an occasional smile and some spunk, despite what just happened.  Mom also did seem to care about her, as did an aunt with her who seemed more emotionally stable.  They agreed that counseling was a good idea, and to see her doctor about a psychiatric referral. Some kids like Amy are born with depression.  Some like Sharon, besides having inborn depression, also have life stresses that contribute.  Both kids need attention- counseling and maybe medicine to get them through bad patches. If your kid seems depressed, telling them to buck up and act happier isn’t enough.  You should ask about suicidal thoughts, why he is depressed, and see his doctor.  Depression is rough, so better that your kid gets the attention that Amy got, rather than Sharon’s. Posted in Depression , Talking with Teenagers , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply Unreasonable Teens, Unreasonable Parents (Hamiltons included) Posted on July 13, 2011 by klfydoctor 2 Every so often a parent brings their teenager to the Emergency Department for a drug test.  The parent is suspicious that their teen is using drugs, even if the teenager denies it.  There is obvious tension in the air between the two.  We politely tell the parents that we can not legally or ethically make teens take drug tests (or pregnancy tests either).  If the teen doesn’t want the test, we can’t make them do it.  What would the parent have us do- hold their adult-sized kid down and catheterize him or her for their urine sample? Communication break-downs between parents and teens lead to a lot of miserable ED visits.  Problems with honestly discussing drug use, and trusting each other, lead to the trouble above.  Even worse, mistrust and anger between kids and parents can lead to depression, violence between parents and kids, and teen suicide.  Teen years are tough enough, and it is even tougher when the teen can’t rely on his folks for sympathy. We all know teenage years are difficult.  New hormones lead to mood swings, love sickness, feelings of awkwardness as the body grows and changes and breaks out in sweat and zits.  Inside that big, lumbering body is a brain swinging from wisdom to toddler tantrum, and back.  Stresses of school, the meaning of life, sleep deprivation, fitting in, all take a toll.  Little problems to an experienced adult are new, huge problems to a teenager. Parents respond to their stressed teenager in two ways.  Parents at their best are understanding, forgiving, and patient.  The other response is anger; anger at the teen’s whining, misbehavior, and snappishness.  We condemn our teens for bad grades, slowness to do chores or find a job, and inappropriate clothes.  Parents often show both understanding and anger in the same day, or the same hour.  I sure do with my three teenagers. The trick is to be more of the first, less of the second.  If you are angry, walk away and cool off before you say hurtful things.  Pick your battles- having it out with them over drugs and alcohol is much more important than dogging them about their clothes, or manners, or speech. Most importantly, rewards are more important than punishment.  Finding something (anything!) to compliment your teen about will get you much farther with them than grounding them for a month for denting the car.  I’m not saying don’t discipline your teen- only that the punishment should be fair and the compliments kind.  Everyone likes to have nice things said to them like “Good job cleaning the kitchen,” or ”your hair looks great.”  Everyone feels wronged when having privileges taken away for mistakes, especially when the mistake was an accident and not intentional. So parents, next time you get really angry at your teen, back off.  Don’t let anger and a loose tongue wound your relationship with your kid.  Cool off, be calm, and remember that your love for your child is more important than your own righteousness. Got that, Scott?

The ophthalmologists of LGH are experts in diagnosing and treating a full range of diseases and disorders of the eye. All of LGH’s eye care facilities aim to give patients the very best experience by providing safe, effective care unmatched anywhere else in Acadiana. The Ophthalmology Departments of Lafayette General Surgical Hospital (LGSH) and Lafayette General Medical Center offer a broad range of clinical, diagnostic and consulting services for the evaluation and treatment, both medically and surgically, of ocular disorders. Our ophthalmologists work with patients to develop treatment plans for the management of important ocular conditions and diseases. These hospitals provide facilities and equipment for the most modern and up-to-date surgical procedures for cataract, cornea, glaucoma, retinal, LASER and other types of eye surgeries. Walk-in visitors to University Hospital & Clinics (UHC) may also obtain referrals to UHC’s Eye Clinic for quick and effective treatment. Through Lafayette General Health, Acadiana has a unique variety of outlets and services to conveniently serve the eye care needs of the entire community. CATALYS Laser Brings New Vision to Cataract Surgeries For patients needing eye surgery, the CATALYS® Precision Laser System is available at Oil Center Surgical Plaza (OCSP). The CATALYS laser is used mostly for cataract surgeries, but is used for other eye procedures as well.  Cataracts often develop in older adults as the lens of the eye hardens and becomes cloudy or less translucent.  This can cause light to appear glary, vision to be blurred and colors to seem muted. Preparing for cataract surgery requires multiple incisions on the covering of the eyeball, and inside the eye around the lens.  Traditionally, these cuts were made by hand, with hand-held tools.  The CATALYS is beneficial because its laser can make these incisions with more accuracy and precision than by hand. The CATALYS is equipped with a guidance system that maps the eye structure in three dimensions and establishes safe-zone parameters.  Since every eyeball is uniquely shaped and configured, being able to plan and customize these incisions makes for a more predictable result and outcome. Removing the cataract using traditional methods required high-energy ultrasound to break up the cataract into pieces for removal.  With CATALYS, the laser cuts a grid-like pattern across the cataract to soften it.  That allows the lens to be removed gently and in clean-cut sections.  This helps leave a better-prepared setting for the replacement lens to be inserted. The end result is that the CATALYS laser reduces redness and discomfort after surgery, and allows for faster visual recovery. Physicians with privileges at OCSP to use the CATALYS laser are Ophthalmologists Jonathan Joseph, Kirk LeBlanc, Ricardo Leoni II and Kevin Swan.  The physicians say they are experiencing wonderful outcomes in vision restoration, especially amongst those candidates in need of multifocal and vision-correcting lenses.

Posted on June 17, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply My college required students to take four blocks of Physical Education, much like high school, except we chose the sports.  We also had to pass a swim test to graduate.  My roommate Brian, who’d never learned to swim, had to use his PE blocks to take swim lessons until he passed that test.  So while the rest of my buddies and me were horsing around in floor hockey or golf lessons, Brian was off to the campus pool in swim trunks, towel around his neck, trailed by jokes about playing in the “kiddie pool,” and “don’t forget your water wings.” Learning to swim and playing in the pool are great ways to spend the hot summer. It’s good exercise and though kids are outdoors, they stay cool.  And they have fun!  More importantly for we in Emergency services, knowing how to swim is good drowning prevention. Proper swim lessons, like in the Boy Scouts, don’t only teach swimming.  They also teach water safety, because even good swimmers can get into trouble, like my buddy Walt. Walt is an ER doctor who had been in the Air Force Pararescue, or “PJs.” This elite team’s mission is to rescue downed pilots, particularly in water. Needless to say, Walt was as capable in water as any Navy Seal.  One day at the beach, however, he and his 8 year-old son got caught in a riptide and were taken out to sea. Hundreds of yards off shore, Walt saw a current that would sweep them back, but the stream he was in prevented him from swimming there.  After hours of trying to break through while holding up his son, growing exhausted, he resigned himself to throwing his son to the beach-bound current before he himself drowned.  Just then a rogue wave slapped them into that good current and they got home. After that, Walt never went to the beach without numerous flotation devices and a long rope.  Good swim lessons likewise teach about safety and rescue strategies like having flotation and other equipment handy.  They also teach the buddy system so everyone is accounted for in a crowd. Playing outdoors in the summer is great exercise too, though not as cooling as swimming.  Kids can get overheated, especially if they are in sports practices.  Several times in July and August we get football players in the Emergency Department with heat exhaustion.  The boys start to get muscle cramps, and then can become sleepy and sometimes confused.  When they are confused or difficult to arouse, we worry about heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency. Dr. James Andrews, a famed sports orthopedic surgeon, wrote a book called “Any Given Monday: Sports Injuries and How to Prevent Them.”  In that book he advocates kids cutting back on organized sports when they are young, to avoid repetitive injuries that he used to see only in college and professional athletes.  This allows for more unstructured outdoor play for kids that’s easier on their joints.  Kid-driven play also helps avoid heat injury. In regular play, there’s no training agenda to drive kids past their comfort zone.  Kids can goof around outside all they want, and when they get hot and thirsty come in to get drinks and cool off.  They take breaks whenever they want.  In coach-driven sports, kids are pushed to the limits of their endurance to improve performance.  Sometimes they are pushed too far, and get over-heated. However, organized sports practice can be made safer. Coaches should allow unlimited water breaks.  Heat injury happens with temperature and dehydration working together to punish; plenty of fluids prevents that.  Breaks should be in the shade.  Teams should practice in cooler times of day, early morning and late afternoon or evening.  Football practice should start with shorts and tee-shirts, with endurance and equipment gradually added in following weeks.  Finally, coaches should watch players for signs of heat exhaustion, just like they watch for signs of concussion.  If players acts groggy, they should be rested and hydrated in the shade. So let your kids play freely outdoors. They should get swimming lessons and have lots of pool time to play and exercise.  If they are outdoors in the yard, be sure they take plenty of water and cooling-off breaks, and have sprinklers to play in.  Come to think of it, maybe football practices should have lots of running through the sprinklers too! Posted in Drowning Prevention , Heat Injury | Leave a reply Heat And Light Posted on June 19, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply If you think pediatricians don’t make mistakes raising their own kids, think again!.  My wife and I had just had our first baby.  When our girl was 6 weeks old, my wife was getting cabin fever, stuck home breast feeding around the clock.  We lived in eastern Maryland then, and decided to take a weekend at the beach for some fresh air and sunshine.  Being a pediatrician and a pediatric nurse, we were careful about the sun- big hat, sun tent, plenty of fluids. We didn’t put sunscreen on baby and unfortunately, didn’t count on sunlight reflected off the sand and off the water.  Baby was lit up from below where her hat and tent didn’t protect and when we brought her home, she was the color of a cooked lobster.  Some experts! Now it’s summer and kids should be outdoors swimming and playing, having fun and using their brains in healthier ways than with a phone, computer, or TV.  However, kids need protection from too much heat and light from the summer sun.  The most dangerous problem is children and teens overheating. The heat-related tragedies are already making the news.  The story typically goes like this: the parent is in a rush, goes into a store and leaves the child in the car.  The parent is detained somehow and by the time he/she gets back to the car, the child is dead.  They always say, “I was only going in for a few minutes,” but unfortunately anything longer than a few minutes is all it takes. Consider this: How long could you sit in a parked car in the sun, engine and A/C off?  Five minutes?  Ten, if you’re strong?  It takes about 40 minutes to bake a cake, about 20 minutes to bake a cupcake.  Now if you’re the cake and can only stand five minutes in the car before you are drenched with sweat and gasping and overheated, how long do you think your cupcake toddler can last?  The lesson is clear: don’t leave kids in a car in the summer at all, for any length of time! Fortunately, these episodes of kids dying in hot cars is rare.  Much more common is heat injury with older kids during summer sports practice.  August is coming and with it, football practice.  I can count on seeing some kids in the Emergency Department with heat cramps, heat exhaustion or worse, heat stroke. Heat cramps are the mildest of the sports heat injuries, where the kid athlete is working out hard, not stretching enough, not drinking enough, and not resting enough between bursts of activity.  He begins to get painful muscle cramps, and this means it’s time to stop, recover, stretch, and hydrate. The next level of injury is heat exhaustion.  In addition to cramps, these kids begin to have dizziness, headache, and weakness from dehydration and over-heating.  If the child-athlete doesn’t take a break at this point, the next, worst, stage is heat stroke: the child becomes confused, lethargic, may stop sweating, and then is at risk for muscle and kidney and brain injury, and death. To prevent heat injury, coaches and team captains should take these precautions: First, athletes need to adapt to the heat.  Start with work-outs of lighter intensity and shorter duration.  Football players should spend the first weeks of summer practice in shorts and t-shirts only; then progressively add intensity, duration, and equipment. The second strategy is adequate hydration and recovery.  Athletes should drink before, during, and after practices.  There should never be limits on access to drink; coaches who restrict fluids are only hurting their kids, hurting their kids’ performance, and should be fired. Finally, direct sun exposure should be minimized.  Teams should have a shady spot to rehydrate between work-outs.  Practices should be scheduled for earlier morning, like for 7am to 10 am instead of 8 to 11.  Afternoon practice should start at 4 or 6 pm instead of 2 pm. Finally, coaches should have an action plan to handle heat injury.  Like surveillance for concussions, coaches should be watching players for signs of cramping, sleepiness, and headaches. We all make mistakes, like when my wife and I accidentally sunburned our new baby at the beach.  Just please don’t make bigger mistakes by not taking heat seriously. Posted in Heat Injury , Sunburn | Leave a reply Boy, Is It Hot Out There! Posted on June 7, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 When I was in high school, summers meant lots of exercise in the heat.  I would go for runs with sweat literally pouring off my arms.  Then came summer soccer practice- push ups and calisthenics, sprints and indian runs with grass clippings stuck to my arms and legs, coaches and captains yelling like army drill sergeants.  A lot of kids quit the team during the first weeks of practice.  Then I was glad for all the running I had done; it was a little comfort that I was maybe suffering less than the kids around me. It is the time of year now when we all start hearing about the heat on the news.  The biggest and saddest stories are the ones about someone leaving their small child strapped in their car seat in the car.  They always say, “I was only going in the store for a few minutes.”  Unfortunately, a few minutes is all it takes to cause injury or death in an infant or toddler because of heat. How long could you stand it in a parked car, engine and A/C off, in the sun?  Five minutes?  Ten minutes?  Now compare people to baking cakes in the oven.  It takes about 40 minutes to bake a cake.  It takes 20 minutes to bake a cupcake.  So imagine you are the cake and your toddler is the cupcake.  Now how long do you think they will last in that parked car?  Again, even a few minutes is too much. Fortunately, those infant and toddler tragedies are rare.  In the Emergency Department we see more cases of teenagers with heat injury.  These are usually kids on the practice field for school sports.  The mildest injury is heat cramps, where the only symptom is painful muscle cramps.  The next degree is heat exhaustion, where the teen has dizziness and weakness and headache from heat exposure and dehydration.  The most severe form of heat injury is heat stroke.  Teens with heat stroke become confused or unconscious, stop sweating, and are at risk for death. Heat injury is preventable.  The first strategy is adaptation.  Athletes should slowly build to the harder work-outs, like I used to with my runs.  Start with work-outs of lighter intensity and shorter duration.  Football players should spend the first weeks of practice in shorts and t-shirts only.  Then progressively add intensity, duration, and equipment. The second strategy is plenty of hydration.  Athletes should drink before, during, and after work-outs, all three!  There should be no limits to access water or sports drinks.  Coaches who restrict fluids are only hurting their kids, and hurting their performance, and should be fired. Thirdly, school team work-outs should be scheduled for the early morning and late evening- start practice at 7am instead of 9am, or 6pm instead of 4pm.  There should be at least two hours between sessions. Finally, coaches should have an action plan to deal with heat injury.  Like surveillance for concussions, coaches should be watching their players for signs of cramping, sleepiness, headaches, weakness. Summer should be a fun time for kids outdoors.  But it’s hot out there, so treat your kids right in the heat.

    } Anesthesia Services Our goal at LGEC is to provide the highest quality sedation to our patients, with their safety and comfort being the top priorities. All sedation at LGEC is given by Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNA's) under the direction of an Anesthesiologist (a medical doctor with a specialty in Anesthesia). Having these specialized professionals in control of the administration and monitoring of sedation allows your gastroenterologist to concentrate all of his attention on your endoscopy procedure and any required therapeutic interventions. GI Specific Pathology Our GI Physicians at LGEC now have the ability to offer an alternative diagnosis and evaluation of pathology specimens to our patients by utilizing the services of GI Pathology, a single-specialty pathology group, staffed entirely by fellowship trained Gastrointestinal Pathologists. This specialized service enables our physicians to get specific, definitive pathology reports, which has not been locally available. Receiving a timely, decisive pathology report eliminates the need for further testing to obtain a diagnosis  reducing costs to our insurance payors and the patient's out-of-pocket expense. Community Awareness and Education LGEC utilizes marketing opportunities to increase community awareness on such vital topics as the value of screening colonoscopy in the prevention of colon cancer. Our facility has published research data and articles; filmed television spots for colon cancer awareness; our physicians frequently speak at meetings, conferences and community events on colon cancer awareness, increased polyp detection with high definition equipment, and identification and removal of flat polyps. Our physicians and Nurse Administrator are connected with several industry committees and groups who are working to establish a reporting criteria and forum to measure quality outcomes in endoscopy to provide community awareness and access to physician outcomes.

    } We use the latest, state of the art technology in all of our procedures and operations. We believe that this enables us to give our patients the highest quality care with the greatest comfort possible. Technology LGEC uses only the latest, state-of-the-art technology in all of our procedures and treatments. The center is totally furnished with the latest high definition endoscopy equipment  and has been since 2007. This gives our physicians the most experience in the capabilities of this technology and the advantages that it offers to our patients. Additionally, our standards of care enable us to give our patients the highest quality procedures with the greatest possible level of comfort. High Definition Colonoscopy Undergoing a high definition (HD) colonoscopy allows your physician to have an increased field of
vision and depth perception, which reveals lesions, particularly right-sided
flat polyps that could not be identified and removed with standard definition
technology. Another advantage from this increase in polyp detection is that the
patient can go for longer intervals between a recommended repeat colonoscopy
after having a negative HD examination. High Definition Gastroscopy A real advantage in high definition upper endoscopy is the feature called ""Narrow Band Imaging,""
which allows the physician to view more definition in the vascular patterns of
the mucosa. This is especially informative in patients with reflux disease. It identifies abnormal tissue patterns at the esophagogastric junction (the
area where the stomach and esophagus meet) when Barrett's Esophagus is
suspected. This increased definition allows for targeted biopsies to increase
diagnostic accuracy. CRH Hemorrhoid Banding System No more messy
ointments, creams or suppositories. No need for painful or complicated
procedures. We use the proprietary CRH ORegan System ® , which doesnt require
surgery or recovery time. The CRH ORegan System ® is a simple, painless and
highly effective procedure (99.1%) that can be performed in less than a minute.
How simple is it? Our physician will place a tiny rubber band around the base
of the hemorrhoid. The banded tissue then shrinks and falls within day or so,
usually without you noticing. And thats it. Once the hemorrhoid is treated, so
are your symptoms! ERBE Generators Our ERBE electrosurgical
generators are the latest generation featuring ""Smart Technology"". Each
unit has a computer-driven ability to measure the patient's density (evaluating
body weight, hydration, tissue resistance) to deliver the exact amount of electrical
current to provide the optimal tissue effect for the patient's requirement to
accomplish needed therapeutic interventions, such as polyp removal or cautery
of a bleeding site. Automated Reprocessing The endoscopy equipment
used during procedures is cleaned and disinfected by an automated process that
exceeds all required standards for safety and infection control. The technology
verifies and records each stage of the disinfection process and downloads all
of the information to hard-drive storage, creating a permanent record of what
equipment (identified by serial number and patient medical record number) was
used on each patient and verifies that each stage of the process was completed
without disruption or error. Medical Records LGEC's Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) system protects your medical record from being lost or destroyed
by fire, water or any type of disaster. EMR provides consistency of
reporting, availability of records and standardization of all records. It also
allows your physician to view your record from another location (such as the
hospital, his office or residence) if you have a problem at a time when the
center is closed. Home | FAQs | Surveys | Site Search | About Us | Our Physicians | Services | Technology | Patient & Visitor Info | News & Events | Contact Us | Site Map © Copyright 2017, Lafayette General Endoscopy Center.  All rights reserved. Site designed by Bizzuka Healthcare Web Design]"

Please call us at (337) 289-8249 if you have any additional questions. Speed up your check-in process! You can now update your information online through our patient portal before you come in. New to our Portal, Online Bill Pay!!!! We Accept Visa, MasterCard and Discover!! To pay your bill online for Drs Abshire, Arterburn, Trawick and Karr click on this link: https://gastroclinic.mygportal.com/ . To pay your bill online for Dr. Jacque Noel click this link and log in: https://noelgiclinic.mygportal.com/ There are some registration forms that will need to be filled out prior to your procedure. The process will take much less time if you have done the paperwork prior to your arrival at LGEC. If you received a packet at the physician's office when your procedure was scheduled, there is a registration packet included. Please fill the forms out and give the completed packet to the receptionist when you arrive for your procedure at the center. If you didn't receive a packet from your physician, the forms can be downloaded by clicking the ""New Patient Forms"" and the ""Registration"" options below. You can also call us and we can fax them to you or you can pick them up here at the center. Our hours of operation are Monday - Friday - 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. (closed on holidays). If you have been here within the last year, you will not need new forms unless there has been a change in the information (change of address, different insurance, etc.) that was listed. Bring your driver's license or picture identification and your insurance cards with you  we need to make copies for your chart. Make sure we have a phone number where you can be reached on the day of your procedure. We may call you to change the time of your arrival if the schedule changes due to a cancellation or delay. Unless you are contacted, arrive at your regularly scheduled time. You must bring someone to drive you home when you are discharged. You will not be able to drive until the following day due to sedation you will receive for your procedure. Your driver does not have to stay here and wait for you  they can leave a phone number, and we will notify them when you are in the recovery room. Your driver should be within 15 minutes of the center when notified. Only bring one person with you for your appointment. We often have more than one physician working at the center at the same time. This means there are twice the number of patients and drivers waiting, and it can become crowded in the waiting room. We do not allow food or beverages in the waiting room. First and foremost, our patients have been fasting for several hours and we do not want people eating or drinking in front of them. We also do not want spills and leftover food and wrappers on the carpet and furniture. There is a vending and sitting area on the second floor of the Burdin Riehl Center and also a coffee shop and cafeteria on the first floor of Lafayette General Medical Center, which can be accessed by the skywalk from the third floor of this building to the hospital. In consideration of others, we ask that patients and visitors put cell phones on vibrate and step into the hall or lobby for phone conversations. There are no cell phones allowed in the patient care areas. We hope that you have found the answers to any questions you might have on this website. Please call us if you require any further information. We look forward to providing your endoscopy needs. Preparing for your first visit to Lafayette General Endoscopy Center?

Our multi-disciplinary weight loss surgery program at Lafayette General Medical Center (LGMC) was created to help alleviate this problem—assisting patients in Acadiana to live a healthier life. If you take a close look at what we have to offer, you will find a program that it is unique in its design and scope. Free educational sessions are open to the public and held twice monthly in Lafayette General Medical Center’s Owen Auditorium. For more information on a Weight Loss Surgery Seminar, click here or call (337) 289-8484 . Our weight loss (bariatric) surgery program at LGMC is distinct. We offer preoperative education as well as postoperative support for patients looking for healthier options. Not only will we guide you through the steps necessary to have bariatric surgery, but we also provide the necessary tools that are fundamental to your postoperative success for many years to come after your surgery. Nutrition, exercise, behavior modification counseling and support groups, are among the resources offered to insure your success after your surgery. Our goal is to offer you a personalized program that will help you lose weight and succeed in reaching your goals. There are many different types of weight loss surgeries, and Lafayette General has the most comprehensive Bariatric surgery on the market. The bariatric surgery department at LGMC was accredited as a metabolic and bariatric surgeries and quality improvement program. This is a joint program of the American College of Surgeons and American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. The Bariatric Surgery Department at LGMC believes that surgery is a tool, not a cure, to help patients lead a healthy life. Lafayette General’s Bariatric Surgery Department performs laparoscopic gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and laparoscopic gastric sleeve procedures. Along with the surgeons, Philip Gachassin, M.D. and Dennis Eschete, M.D., the bariatric support team includes a registered nurse, dietitian, patient advocate, behavior modification educator, licensed practical counselor and an exercise physiologist. Non-Surgical Weight Loss Program Lafayette General Medical Center’s Bariatric Surgery program has developed a comprehensive program for people who want to lose weight, but for whom surgery is not a desire or option. The Medically Supervised Weight Loss Program is an ideal avenue for patients who may exceed the weight limit for surgery, do not have insurance to cover the cost of surgery or may just be interested in losing only 20 to 30 pounds. The program, underway since November 2012, helps people make realistic dietary changes under the continuous guidance of a physician, dietitian and support staff. Benjamin Doga, M.D., oversees the program at Acadiana Weight Loss Surgery, located at Lafayette General Surgical Hospital. Scheduled visits occur every Tuesday and include sessions with a dietitian, behavior modification educator and exercise physiologist. The goal is to help people safely lose weight and keep it off by learning new food choices and habits. It is essentially a lifestyle modification program that pursues the best course for each individual. Participants can choose a three-month, six-month or one-year plan. Dr. Doga will evaluate patients to help determine their best options, which can include meal replacement and/or pharmaceuticals to help suppress appetite, and participants will receive constant support from professionals throughout the program. In addition, the support staff works with LGMC Wellness at the Townhouse fitness center for exercise and training regimens and routines.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Teen Health Care Throw Like a Girl Posted on April 6, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Corey Gardner, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “You can’t beat me!” yelled Jacob, the ringleader of the third-grade boys who controlled the playground at recess.  He was yelling at me, the scrawny little thing in the ankle-length blue dress with flowers on it. “Oh yes she can, and she will, even in that dress,” countered my friend Reggie.  I stood silently, waiting for the race to start.  Reggie and I had played lots of tag and touch football, he knew my speed, and that no dress would hamper it.  With the distance marked and the rules set, we lined up.  ”Go!”  I took off, blue skirt streaming behind me like a sail. Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. Posted in Play time , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply A Tale of Two Teenagers Posted on January 27, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Hard to believe, Amy loves the Army.  She’s in boot camp, enjoying lots of exercise, full days, new jargon to learn, and she even likes the lectures on Army protocol. It’s stressful to be sure; it’s supposed to be tough.  Some girls are fainting, some are washing out because they can’t hack it, some stay up too late and lose sleep. Amy has her eyes on the prize- graduating and moving up.  When she gets anxious, she swallows it and moves on. Uncharacteristic for her, she’s eating well and going to bed early.  Her parents are proud, not only for her accomplishment but for how far Amy has come.  Her life wasn’t always this way. From an early age, Amy was having a rough go.  She had trouble paying attention in first grade, though she was highly intelligent.  She angered some teachers with her pointed, seemingly rude commentaries, though other teachers “got” her. She was tried on ADHD medications, which helped for a time, but then began causing side effects where Amy acted confused and panicky.  By high school, it was clear Amy was depressed.  She was sullen, didn’t get along with most of her classmates, and scraped out poor grades. Despite grasping the material, she just didn’t care enough to get papers in on time or study for tests. Amy had no obvious reason for depression.  She had two loving, educated parents and two happy siblings.  At the first sign of trouble with attention or mood, she got the best doctors and therapists.  As Amy got older and was able to verbalize what was going on inside, it seemed her depression was “chemical:”  she was just born that way, with no external reasons like bullying or her looks. Anti-depressant medication helped, as did continued counseling.  Her parents cheered her on through thick and thin, and as she got older Amy’s life began looking up.  College was much better than high school as far as academics and having friends. She had positive dreams for her future.  Joining the Army wasn’t her parents first choice; heck, even with a bachelor’s degree she enlisted rather than take on the responsibility of being an officer. But now they were singing a different tune. Sharon has it much worse than Amy.  I saw Sharon in the Emergency Department last month.  She came by ambulance after being beaten by a gang of boys.  They ran up behind her, knocked her down, and kicked her repeatedly in the head and chest. There had apparently been some bad blood between Sharon’s friends and other factions in the neighborhood. From our computer record I saw that Sharon had had a tough life already, though only 15 years-old. She had been seen by us twice for sexual assaults, another time for being beaten up, and once to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal thoughts. She came from a rough house in a rough neighborhood.  Her mom obviously had mental illness of her own, from the pressured speech of hyperactivity or drug use, to her peculiar tattoos.  Mom yelled a lot, at Sharon and us, though this seemed to be not from anger but how she usually spoke. Certainly Sharon’s depression has not gotten the attention that Amy’s did.  Though she had been in hospital for depression, Sharon isn’t on anti-depressants and isn’t in counseling.  Chaos rules her home life: her father’s gone, and she bounces between mom’s and the homes of several other families. Her school and neighborhood aren’t safe. Despite all this, I have some hope for Sharon.  Kids can be resilient, and Sharon still had an occasional smile and some spunk, despite what just happened.  Mom also did seem to care about her, as did an aunt with her who seemed more emotionally stable.  They agreed that counseling was a good idea, and to see her doctor about a psychiatric referral. Some kids like Amy are born with depression.  Some like Sharon, besides having inborn depression, also have life stresses that contribute.  Both kids need attention- counseling and maybe medicine to get them through bad patches. If your kid seems depressed, telling them to buck up and act happier isn’t enough.  You should ask about suicidal thoughts, why he is depressed, and see his doctor.  Depression is rough, so better that your kid gets the attention that Amy got, rather than Sharon’s. Posted in Depression , Talking with Teenagers , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply A Tale Of Two Teenagers Posted on September 11, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply Ben grew up with asthma, but at 15 he seemed to have outgrown it.  Then this fall he began to cough and feel tight.  His mom took him to a quick-care, where he was prescribed an inhaler. A few weeks later he caught another cold virus, began to cough and wheeze again, and started using the inhaler he had left in his school bag. Ben was a busy teenager, and didn’t use his inhaler regularly.  He took puffs only when when he felt tight.  He began to get more tired and out of breath despite the inhaler, but he didn’t tell his mom.  He felt this was his business, and his mom nagged him enough as it was- about his grades, his phone use, his messy room.  He didn’t need more nagging about his medicine. Then one evening he suddenly couldn’t breathe. It was a struggle to pull in a breath, and he had to tell his mom.  When she saw that he couldn’t speak and was so air hungry, she called the ambulance. After an hour in the Emergency Department and lots more medicines, he was put in Intensive Care, still wheezing. Ben’s story is common with teenage asthmatics.  Teenagers generally get poor health care, even those with chronic, potentially life-threatening conditions like asthma or depression.  Littler kids see the doctor a lot, given all the vaccines they need.  They get sick a lot more too, meaning more trips to the office. When they get to be teens, there’s less reason for kids to go to the doctor.  The vaccines are fewer and far between.  Teens stay pretty well.  When they do get sick, rather than fight to get into their regular doctor, parents sometimes opt for more convenient walk-in clinics. However, losing contact with your child’s doctor is a problem.  Sure the vaccines are fewer, but when you don’t go to your “medical home” to get seen, you don’t get reminded the important teen vaccines and may miss them: the meningococcal vaccine against meningitis, the tetanus booster, and the cancer-preventing HPV vaccine.  And a walk-in doctor is less likely to ask about your teen’s chronic conditions which need surveillance, like asthma, or depression. Ashley, 14 years-old, was always a glum kid.  She kept to herself, rarely smiled, had few friends.  About a month ago she broke up with her first boyfriend.  This made her feel even more worthless than usual, and she lately has been thinking that the world would be better without her.  Today she told a friend that she was thinking of taking a lot of pills. Ashley’s friend, burdened by this knowledge, stewed through several periods at school, and then told a counselor.  Though this made the friend feel like a tattle-tale, she actually saved Ashley’s life. The counselor called in Ashley and her parents, Ashley admitted her suicidal thoughts, and she was brought to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Depression, like asthma, can be a chronic condition in teenagers.  Like our asthmatic teen from above, teens don’t like talking to parents about their condition.  They are embarrassed by it; they feel like freaks, with their asthma or depression making them different than others.  They also don’t like being nagged.  Throughout her childhood Ashley’s parents harped on her about her depression, and she had been to counseling several times.  She didn’t like counseling: who wants to talk about their feelings when their feelings are so negative? Having a regular doctor is one way to keep tabs on depression.  At well visits, besides vaccines and school physicals, doctors should be asking teens about their feelings.  If kids seem depressed, their doctor isn’t afraid to ask the harder questions: do you want to kill yourself?  Why are things worse now: is it problems with your parents, your friends, your school?  The ”medical home” is all about prevention, unlike an Emergency Department or walk-in clinic, where it’s about fixing the kid’s immediate problem and moving on. If you are worried that your teen is depressed and may be suicidal, fortunately Lafayette has the Jacob Crouch Foundation, a suicide awareness and support group.  You can visit their website at crouchfoundation.org to learn suicide facts and myths, how to recognize signs, and how to get help. Even better, get help earlier by sticking with your kid’s doctor!

Posted on July 1, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Susila Shanmuganathan, Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s summer time, and the heat is on…on your child’s skin!  With the sun out, her soft and beautiful skin is at risk for sunburn.  Sunburn is very common, with more than 30% of adults and 70% of children and adolescents getting at least one sunburn per year.  Although most aren’t severe, a lifetime of sun exposure significantly increases the risk of skin cancer, and wrinkles.  And it hurts!  When kids hurt, they whine, and no one wants that on vacation. Sunburn can be sneaky.  Unlike other types of burns, sunburn may not show immediately, because it takes three to five hours for redness to develop after being out.  Redness peaks at about 12 to 24 hours after sun exposure and fades over 72 hours. What increases your risk of sunburn?  One factor is the amount of pigment in your skin, called melanin.  Melanin protects from burns, so really pale kids burn easier than their darker skinned friends.  Also, where you are in the World counts.  The close you are to the equator and the higher your altitude, the more rays you get and risk increases.  So if you’re heading to Central America or the Caribbean with the kiddos, or hiking in the Rockies, pack the sunblock! Another thing we often forget is that certain medications make skin more sensitive to burning.  These include certain antibiotics, some blood pressure medications, and even something as simple as ibuprofen.  So before you go the beach, make sure your 15-year-old on Doxycycline for his acne is okay with having a red face for a few days. Better still, put on the block! If your child does get sunburn, there are treatments.  First, stay out of the sun until the redness and pain resolve.  Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, or generic) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can relieve the pain.  These should be started as soon as the burn is noticed, since the benefits tend to decrease after 24 hours.  Cool compresses, aloe-based lotions, and lotions with local anesthetic may help too. A friend of mine once went on a misson trip to the Philippines.  He schlepped his snorkeling gear half way around the world because he had heard about the beautiful coral reefs there.  When his day at the beach came, he forgot about sunblock or wearing a sunshirt.  While snorkeling the cool water kept him from realizing what the near-equatorial sun was doing to his skin.  The next morning he had sunburn so bad it blistered his back and shoulders- a second degree sunburn!  Sleeping was tough, but fortunately aloe was handy and he smeared that on generously. Lesson to be learned: when in the beam, use the ‘screen!  Here are some tips to using sunscreen most effectively.  Put it on 15 minutes before going out in the sun: the better it dries, the harder it is to rub or sweat off.  Be sure to cover all surfaces, including ears. I remember an old OB/GYN attending, an avid sailor, who had notches in his ears where pre-cancerous growths had had to be cut out. Applying sunscreen just once isn’t enough.  Sunscreen is washed off by water, rubbed off by towels and sand, and sweat off when your kids run around in the heat. You need to re-apply at least every 2 hours during peak burning times (roughly 10 am to 5pm) to properly protect your kids.  Apply more often for the very active swimming and running and toweling kids. Another strategy is to avoid sun exposure in the first place.  Shade is your kid’s friend- umbrellas, beach tents, leafy trees, shaded porches.  Some fair-skinned kids just can’t get enough sunblock, they burn so easily.  These kids benefit from protective clothing- long sleeve shirts, long pants, big brimmed hats, and sunglasses. They now make shirts and pants that are light enough to be cool and have SPF (Sun Protective Factor) ratings just like sunscreen. Fun in the sun is something that even the littlest ones look forward to, but be prepared for the damage that can be done.   Remember: cover that beautiful baby skin with protective clothing and high SPF sunblock to keep the fun, in the sun! Posted in Sunburn | Leave a reply Heat And Light Posted on June 19, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply If you think pediatricians don’t make mistakes raising their own kids, think again!.  My wife and I had just had our first baby.  When our girl was 6 weeks old, my wife was getting cabin fever, stuck home breast feeding around the clock.  We lived in eastern Maryland then, and decided to take a weekend at the beach for some fresh air and sunshine.  Being a pediatrician and a pediatric nurse, we were careful about the sun- big hat, sun tent, plenty of fluids. We didn’t put sunscreen on baby and unfortunately, didn’t count on sunlight reflected off the sand and off the water.  Baby was lit up from below where her hat and tent didn’t protect and when we brought her home, she was the color of a cooked lobster.  Some experts! Now it’s summer and kids should be outdoors swimming and playing, having fun and using their brains in healthier ways than with a phone, computer, or TV.  However, kids need protection from too much heat and light from the summer sun.  The most dangerous problem is children and teens overheating. The heat-related tragedies are already making the news.  The story typically goes like this: the parent is in a rush, goes into a store and leaves the child in the car.  The parent is detained somehow and by the time he/she gets back to the car, the child is dead.  They always say, “I was only going in for a few minutes,” but unfortunately anything longer than a few minutes is all it takes. Consider this: How long could you sit in a parked car in the sun, engine and A/C off?  Five minutes?  Ten, if you’re strong?  It takes about 40 minutes to bake a cake, about 20 minutes to bake a cupcake.  Now if you’re the cake and can only stand five minutes in the car before you are drenched with sweat and gasping and overheated, how long do you think your cupcake toddler can last?  The lesson is clear: don’t leave kids in a car in the summer at all, for any length of time! Fortunately, these episodes of kids dying in hot cars is rare.  Much more common is heat injury with older kids during summer sports practice.  August is coming and with it, football practice.  I can count on seeing some kids in the Emergency Department with heat cramps, heat exhaustion or worse, heat stroke. Heat cramps are the mildest of the sports heat injuries, where the kid athlete is working out hard, not stretching enough, not drinking enough, and not resting enough between bursts of activity.  He begins to get painful muscle cramps, and this means it’s time to stop, recover, stretch, and hydrate. The next level of injury is heat exhaustion.  In addition to cramps, these kids begin to have dizziness, headache, and weakness from dehydration and over-heating.  If the child-athlete doesn’t take a break at this point, the next, worst, stage is heat stroke: the child becomes confused, lethargic, may stop sweating, and then is at risk for muscle and kidney and brain injury, and death. To prevent heat injury, coaches and team captains should take these precautions: First, athletes need to adapt to the heat.  Start with work-outs of lighter intensity and shorter duration.  Football players should spend the first weeks of summer practice in shorts and t-shirts only; then progressively add intensity, duration, and equipment. The second strategy is adequate hydration and recovery.  Athletes should drink before, during, and after practices.  There should never be limits on access to drink; coaches who restrict fluids are only hurting their kids, hurting their kids’ performance, and should be fired. Finally, direct sun exposure should be minimized.  Teams should have a shady spot to rehydrate between work-outs.  Practices should be scheduled for earlier morning, like for 7am to 10 am instead of 8 to 11.  Afternoon practice should start at 4 or 6 pm instead of 2 pm. Finally, coaches should have an action plan to handle heat injury.  Like surveillance for concussions, coaches should be watching players for signs of cramping, sleepiness, and headaches. We all make mistakes, like when my wife and I accidentally sunburned our new baby at the beach.  Just please don’t make bigger mistakes by not taking heat seriously. Posted in Heat Injury , Sunburn | Leave a reply Sun Exposure Posted on June 15, 2009 by klfydoctor 2 This morning Tracy Wirtz and I talked about sun exposure and preventing sun burns.  Skin cancer is more common than people think, and is quite preventable.  Also, sun burn hurts and few things are more miserable than a child unable to sleep at night because of sun burn pain. Do you wear a seat belt?  Do you lock your doors at night?  If you care enough to do these safety measures, then you should put sunscreen on you and your kids.  Put it on ten minutes before the kids get into the water.  Re-apply it once or twice if you are out more than four hours, or if your kids are in the water more than 30 minutes. Babies need sunscreen too.  Adult sunscreens are ok.  However, babies (and particularly babies under 6 months-old) should be kept out of the sun, under an umbrella, hat, and long loose clothes.  Beware!- reflection off water or sand can cause sunburn- I’ve made this mistake myself when my oldest child was 6 weeks old! If your child gets sunburn, the best treatment is moisturizer lotion and ibuprofen or tylenol for pain.  If the sunburn develops blister, red streaks, or pus, see your doctor.

This winter we’ve seen nearby outbreaks of Mumps in Arkansas and Texas.  Last week a mother brought her 3 year-old daughter into the Emergency Department worried about just that.  The girl had fever and headache and mom had just heard the news.  Instead the girl turned out to have influenza virus, which causes many of the same symptoms.  But this raised the question: what exactly is the Mumps? Though it sounds like a muppet character, the mumps is an illness caused by a highly contagious virus.  The classic sign of mumps is swollen parotid glands, which are glands at the back of your cheeks.  When they swell you look like a chipmunk. Mumps usually starts with fever, headache, and maybe vomiting.  Symptoms also include cough, runny nose, poor appetite, muscle aches, and generally feeling run down.  Sure sounds like the flu- no wonder that mom was worried! The biggest concern about mumps is that in rare cases it can cause encephalitis, or brain infection and swelling.  In teenagers and adults, it can also cause exquisitely painful swelling of testicles or ovaries.  Before the mumps vaccine was invented in 1967, people were understandably scared of this disease. Now with the MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella) vaccine, mumps has mostly passed into history books, except for the occasional case. If there is a nearby outbreak, what do you do?  First, speak to your doctor.  If your child has concerning symptoms, she can order the mumps blood test.  A big clue to whether your child has the mumps is exposure- was your child around someone with mumps? Figuring this out can be tricky, because it can be weeks after exposure before you begin to have symptoms.  Who remembers where they were two weeks ago- it’s tough enough remembering what you had for lunch yesterday!  So usually when it comes to the individual kid, we count on the classic chipmunk-cheeks to make the diagnosis. How do you get the mumps anyway? Transmission is by respiratory droplets, which means an infected kid coughs and sneezes, or wipes his slimy hands, on his playmates.  The new victims stick those virus-laden droplets on their fingers, into their noses and mouths. So to prevent mumps, kids should do the things to prevent catching other infectious diseases, like colds and stomach viruses: they should wash their hands.  Frequent hand-washing should be taught and encouraged at home and school.  Hand sanitizer dispensers are readily available in public places, and are a reasonable substitute.  I teach kids to wash hands to the Happy Birthday song- if you wash all surfaces of your hands using the amount of time it takes to sing the song, you’ve done a great job of disinfecting. Also use disinfectant wipes to clean household and school surfaces.  Those respiratory droplets and their viruses can linger on tables and doorknobs, and contaminate unsuspecting hands that touch them later.  Teach your kids to cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbows- this keeps grubby hands from infecting surfaces too. If your child gets the mumps, the only treatment is for symptoms- there’s no medicine to make it go away quicker.  Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen for pain and fever.  The chipmunk cheeks or swollen testicles of mumps can really hurt, so don’t skimp on those medicines!  Ice packs can also soothe these sensitive parts.  Most kids and adults get over mumps in about 2 weeks.  Occasionally children need hospitalization for pain control or IV fluids.  If they get encephalitis, they’ll need intensive care to control brain swelling. Vaccination is great protection against mumps.  Kids get their first MMR shot at 12 months-old, and the second before kindergarten.  This vaccine is very safe, much safer than the car ride to the doctor’s to get it!  Some get a mild fever a week after vaccination, but serious complications are quite rare.  Like any vaccine, your child is incredibly more likely to catch and be harmed by mumps, than be harmed by the vaccine. So all concerned moms and dads out there, if your child has flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, headache, fatigue) with swollen cheeks, it might be the mumps!  See your doctor for testing.  But with vaccination, odds are you won’t ever be in this worrisome place.

Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days!

Posted on March 10, 2017 by klfydoctor This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chris Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in  Lafayette. Dreaded words at 7 pm on Friday night: “Mommy, Daddy, my throat hurts.”  Doctor’s closed, nowhere to turn.  It’s a common complaint, especially in my house with three girls. You’ve had sore throats yourself, and know-they hurt! Pharyngitis- doctor talk for throat inflammation- accounts for about 12 million office and ER visits yearly.  Pharyngitis has two main causes- viral (about 85% of cases), and bacterial (about 15%).  Many viruses cause sore throats, like adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza (“the flu”).  The most common bacteria is Group A Streptococcus, a.k.a. Strep Throat. It’s hard to tell the difference between strep and viral pharyngitis.  Besides throat pain, both cause headache, fever, and fatigue.  However, viruses tend to have more cough and runny nose.  But having those doesn’t exclude strep! There’s a few rules for doctors to separate the two.  First, strep throat happens mostly after age 3- red throats in babies and toddlers are rarely bacterial.  Second, if the child has a fine-bumpy, sand-papery rash on the trunk and face, that’s the “scarlet fever” of strep. The most important rule is that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it’s tough to differentiate the two without a strep test. The test is a throat swab that indicates if strep bacteria is present. It’s a good test, but not perfect, catching about 85% of strep throats.  Thus your doctor must weigh the symptoms, the exam, AND the strep test to decide if your child has strep.  If it’s strep, he needs an antibiotic.  If it’s viral, antibiotics don’t kill viruses. This is the kicker for parents.  Sore throats hurt, and everyone wants them gone. Many want antibiotics, thinking they will help.  But they won’t stop viruses, and we don’t give unnecessary antibiotics for good reasons.  Antibiotics have side effects- yeast infections, stomach upset, and possibly allergic reactions.  Most importantly, when your body is exposed to antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotics, and when you do need them to fight that bacteria, they won’t work. We’ve all had throat pain, and it’s miserable.  Dr. Hamilton tells of having yearly sore throats as a teenager.  When he got them, he remembers praying for the pain to go, counting the days of misery, and vowing to never again take feeling good for granted! Like we mentioned above, there’s no cure for viral sore throats.  The virus must run it’s course, typically 2 to 4 days.  If it’s a bacterial strep throat, which again is the minority of cases, only then will an antibiotic help.  So how to treat those viral illnesses that your child must “ride out?” Dr. Hamilton doesn’t remember taking medicine for his sore throats, besides throat sprays and lozenges.  And often when we see kids in the Emergency Department, parents haven’t given anything for pain either.  For your child’s sake, please do! There’s two medicines for pain and fever, perfectly safe for kids: Acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).  These come in many forms and flavors to make them easier for kids to take- liquids, chewable tabs; and for toddlers who spit out medicine instead of swallowing, acetaminophen rectal suppositories. No prescription necessary. Many parents, afraid to overdose their kids, don’t give enough medicine for the pain or fever.  Again, it’s quite safe to give what’s advised on the box for your child’s age or weight.  Still unsure?  Call your doctor’s office to double-check dosing. Give lots of fluids to help your kid feel better.  She may not eat much, and that’s okay. Fluids are more important, and she’s not going to starve in a few days.  If she does want food, light meals are best, like grits, oatmeal, or soup.  Popsicles and ice cream can soothe throats too. Keep your child out of school or daycare- don’t let them spread the illness to others. They won’t feel like learning anyway.  If your child has strep, they must stay out of school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, since it’s highly contagious. If your kid keeps getting strep after strep infection, your doctor can refer him to an ENT surgeon for tonsillectomy.  For the vast majority of sore throats though, 2 to 4 days and things will pass.  Push fluids, give pain medicine, and don’t take feeling good for granted again.

Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child.

The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning. Posted in Allergies , Rashes | Leave a reply Is That Measles??? Posted on June 25, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Jesse Livingston, a family practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. Rashes are a common reason parents bring their children to the doctor. Sometimes the parents get so alarmed by a rash that they come to the Emergency Department.  Maybe the child has been mildly ill for a few days- some cough, some fever, but has been doing okay.  Then one morning the kid wakes up covered head to toe with red spots!  Not only does the rash look horrible, but Grandma chimes in with the worst cases: “Looks like measles!”  ”Could be meningitis!”  Get him seen!  Now! To Grandma’s credit, in her earlier years rashes were sometimes the herald of life-threatening infections.  However, these days those bad illnesses- meningitis, measles, rubella, pneumococcus- are prevented by your child’s vaccinations.  The vast majority of infectious rashes today are benign. Viral rashes (what doctors call “exanthems”) are extremely common and usually go away within a few days.  Generally theses rashes appear red and blotchy and are present from head to toe.  Unlike allergic rashes, they are not swollen or “raised.”  Many viruses can cause a similar-appearing rash as the skin has only a limited amount of responses. This can make it difficult to tell what virus is responsible. Viruses can affect many different parts of the body besides the skin.  For example, the common cold viruses make a person cough and sneeze, but may also cause a rash.  The list of viruses that cause rashes is long.  Some of the more common are Roseola (virus HHV-6) and Fifth Disease (Parvovirus).  These viruses often start with a fever and then in a few days the rash comes.  A more unusual rash is Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, caused by the Coxsackie virus.  This virus causes a strange, spotty rash to appear on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and inside the mouth.  It can cause fevers and diarrhea as well.  Unlike most viral rashes, the sores and spots of Coxsackie are painful. Like our child from above that scared mom and Grandma with his head-to-toe spots, viral rashes can look pretty freaky.  They can look like red lace on the skin, or like leopard spots all over- even the top of the head!  Though they look pretty bad, they usually don’t feel bad. They mostly don’t itch or hurt and there is no specific treatment required.  There is nothing to put on the rash that will make it feel better or go away sooner. The child often does not feel well, but that is because of the virus, not the rash. Like above, viral rashes come with other symptoms: fever, fatigue, headache, no appetite, aches, and irritability.  Supportive care at home is the best treatment.  Make sure the child stays hydrated.  Not eating is fine.  If the child is drinking enough to make pee once or twice per day, you’re doing okay.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen can lower the fever and reduce the aches and pains.  Antihistamines may help with occasional itching. These rashes usually only last for a few days. The main reason to see a doctor with a rash is if the child acts truly sick.  These warning signs are: poor drinking leading to urination less than once per day, worsening fatigue such that the kid becomes progressively harder to wake up, or shortness of breath.  If you are worried that your child is getting sicker, call your doctor.  They can steer you to the office or the Emergency Department. It is important to note that viruses that cause rashes can be contagious.  Close contact with others should be avoided until the rash is gone, and take special care to avoid exposure to pregnant women or people with immune problems. Childhood rashes are usually benign, go away by themselves, and often go with other symptoms.  Vaccinations prevent many of the harmful diseases that cause rashes, so keep your child’s immunizations up to date.  If you have any concerns about the rash or the warning signs above, call your doctor.  She can help decide if your child needs to be seen, and tell you Its Not The Measles.

    } Colorectal Cancer Symptoms It is important that anyone at any age who has symptoms of colorectal cancer be fully evaluated with a colonoscopy to rule out cancer. Watching and waiting is not an acceptable option. Remember, colorectal cancer can be present without any symptoms at all.  So, screening is important to finding cancer early, when it is most curable. Symptoms can include: A change in bowel habits  constipation or diarrhea that lasts more than a couple of weeks. A feeling that the bowel does not empty completely. Bright red or very dark blood in the stool, black stools that may indicate hidden blood. Stools that look narrower or thinner than normal. Abdominal discomfort such as frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness or cramps. Weight loss with no known explanation. Constant tiredness or fatigue. Unexplained anemia (low number of red blood cells).

} How do I make an appointment for an examination at Lafayette General Endoscopy Center? How does getting a colonoscopy keep someone from getting colon cancer? How often does a person need a colonscopy? I have heard some frightening stories about pain during these types of examinations that prevent me from having a colonoscopy.  What should I do? I have heartburn a lot. Could this be serious? Billing FAQ's How much will I owe for my procedure? I paid what I was told to pay on the day of the procedure, so why am I getting an additional bill? What if I paid you more than my insurance company said I owed you? Who provides Anesthesia services and what should I excpect? Q: How do I make an appointment for an examination at Lafayette General Endoscopy Center? A:         You can call the office of our physician partners directly to schedule an appointment  you do not need a referral.  To schedule with Dr. Abshire or Dr. Arterburn, the office number is (337) 232-6697.  The office number for Dr. Noel is (337) 235-9779. Back to Top Q: How does getting a colonoscopy keep someone from getting colon cancer? A:         A colonoscopy allows a physician to examine the lining of your colon. This allows the physician to identify and remove any lesions or growths, called polyps, that grow on the colon walls and can become malignant over time. Removing these growths before they reach this advanced stage prevents colon cancer. Back to Top Q: How often does a person need a colonscopy? A:         Recommended guidelines suggest a screening exam at age 50, if you are a person at standard risk for colon cancer. If no polyps or abnormalities are found at that time, your physician will suggest a repeat colonoscopy in 7 - 10 years. If polyps are found, the pathology report on the removed tissue determines your future examination intervals. Back to Top Q: I have heard some frightening stories about pain during these types of examinations that prevent me from having a colonoscopy.  What should I do? A:         At LGEC, we use the highest quality sedation available for outpatient endoscopy today.  This sedation is given to our patients and monitored during their procedure by a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist under the direction of an Anesthesiologist  the safest standard of care available in the industry.  The patient slowly goes to sleep when the medication is administered through an IV; feels nothing during the procedure; and wakes up in recovery after the exam is over.  Our patients report an extremely high satisfaction rate with the sedation they receive at the facility. You do not need to worry about experiencing pain. Back to Top Q: I have heartburn a lot. Could this be serious? A:         Heartburn is a signal that acid from the stomach is washing back up into the esophagus.  The stomach has thick, muscular walls that can withstand the acid necessary for the digestion of food.  The esophagus has thin walls that do not provide this protection against acid.  Frequent exposure to acid damages the lining of the esophagus and, over time, can cause a condition called Barretts Esophagus.  This damage can cause a malignancy in the effected area.  It is important to see a physician for medication and diet recommendations, as well as lifestyle changes, to improve this situation.  Your physician may also suggest a gastroscope, an examination which allows a visual inspection of the lining of your esophagus and stomach to determine if damage to the esophagus has taken place.  Biopsies of the area may be taken to evaluate the extent of tissue injury.   Patients with an established diagnosis of Barretts should be followed closely with surveillance biopsies at regular intervals. Back to Top Billing FAQ's Q: How much will I owe for my procedure? A:         Our facility will call your insurance company and get estimated benefits for your procedure. We will then give you an estimated quote of the remaining patient financial responsibility prior to you coming in, either by phone or by mail. In addition to the quoted facility and physician charges, you will receive separate billings for anesthesia services and possible pathology services, if indicated. The anesthesia and pathology services will bill directly from their offices. LGEC requires payment at the time of service. If financial arrangements are requested, they must be established prior to your procedure. We accept the following payment options: cash, check, VISA and MasterCard. Back to Top Q: I paid what I was told to pay on the day of the procedure, so why am I getting an additional bill? A: When we request pre-certification benefits from your insurance company, the quote is given for a basic procedure. Any therapeutic interventions required, such as biopsies, polyp removal, dilations, etc., are additional charges and change the cost of your procedure. Although this will increase the payable amount by your insurance company, it may also increase your payable portion. In that event, you will receive a bill for your remaining balance. Back to Top Q: What if I paid you more than my insurance company said I owed you? A: In the event that your insurance company pays more for your procedure than initially quoted, there may be an overpayment on your account. This money will be refunded to you once all insurance payments have been received and posted. We run refund reports at the end of each month and refund any money due to patients at that time. Back to Top Q: Who provides Anesthesia services and what should I excpect? A:         Anesthesia at LGEC is provided by Parish Anesthesia Services. It is likely that two anesthesia providers will be involved in your care; an Anesthesiologist and a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). Depending on the billing policy set by your insurance carrier, you may see a separate charge for each anesthesia provider, or one charge combining both components. Your Anesthesiologist leads this anesthesia care team which monitors and manages your vital body functions during your procedure, and is personally responsible for supervision of all anesthesia services. This doctor is also responsible for managing medical problems that might arise related to the procedure, as well as any chronic medical conditions you may have, such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart problems. The CRNA is a specially trained anesthesia provider who works under the direction of the Anesthesiologist to ensure your comfort and safety throughout your procedure. A member of your anesthesia care team will be with you throughout your procedure and recovery. If you have any questions regarding anesthesia billing, please contact Beth Crowley at (800) 242-1131 extension 4355.

Posted on July 29, 2014 by klfydoctor 6 This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Danielle Duhon, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. First the child complains of chest pain.  She might even say it in scarier terms: “My heart hurts.”  Then mom puts a hand on daughter’s chest- mom can feel her heart beating!   Maybe Uncle Joe just died of heart disease.  Now it’s panic time! Chest pain and palpitations are scary things.  Adults think about heart problems and assume the worst.  After all, we have been told over and over: if you have chest pain, get seen, it could be a heart attack.  In kids however, chest pain is rarely the heart- it’s usually strains in the chest wall- ribs, cartilege, and muscle. Sometimes it’s heart burn or occasionally lung issues. But what about palpitations- that feeling of heart pounding?  Your child complains, you feel their chest, and you’re certain the heart is going to jump right out!  Before you lose your cool, try to think.  Lots of things can cause your child’s heart to race: recent activity, caffeine, or many medicines.  If your child has been running around or doing other high-energy exercise, have them rest for a moment.  See if it slows down. Consider other causes of a pounding heart.  Caffeine can ramp up your child’s heart rate. Soda, coffee, and especially energy drinks all contain caffeine and other stimulants. The extra ingredients that give energy drinks their “boost,” like guanara, can be more stimulating than caffeine and make the heart race like crazy.  Now there are “energy” candies, gum, gels, and water mix-ins.  With all that stimulant coursing through your veins, it’s no wonder your heart is going BA-DUM, BA-DUM! There are several medications that can push the heart. Even if your kid is adult-sized, children metabolize medications differently than adults. Always read the bottle or talk to your doctor to make sure the medication and dose are safe.  Examples of medications that can stimulate the heart include antihistamines (benadryl, chlorpheniramine, hydroxyzine, zyrtec, claritin, allegra), decongestants (pseudophedrine, phenylephrine), and cough suppressants (dextromethorphan). Besides caffeine and over-the-counter medications, your child could be prescribed a medication that can cause palpitations.  These include stimulants to treat ADHD or inhalers for asthma.  If a kid combines those medications with other stimulating medications or caffeinated drinks, he is getting double duty and can certainly have a pounding heart. Unfortunately some teenagers smoke cigarettes (real or electronic) or use chewing tobacco.  These contain nicotine, which is a stimulant.  Used alone or in combination with medications, caffeinated or “energy” drinks, and/or prescriptions, nicotine will certainly get some teenagers’ hearts going overtime. Finally, anxiety is a common cause of palpitations.  Some kids are worriers.  Kids have lots to worry about.  There is pressure to do well in school.  There can be family strife like parental fighting and divorce, bullying siblings, or loss of a loved one through moving or death.  There are social worries: am I too fat/ugly/stupid/boring/etc? Some kids also worry about the big questions: Will the world end?  What is the meaning of life?  Does the little red-haired girl like me? Some kids live with worry so much they internalize it and don’t realize that worries are the cause of their pounding heart.  Sometimes we ask the child what is worrying them and they can’t say because they are so used to the worry that they don’t realize it IS a worry. Or they are afraid to talk about it in front of a parent.  This is where counseling can be helpful so the child can explore and diffuse the anxiety. Now don’t hesitate to call your doctor if your child is having a pounding heart with dizziness, fainting spells, or breathlessness.  There are medical conditions that need be checked.  If you can’t talk to your doctor and are concerned, you can go to the Emergency Department. But perhaps you can think back and figure it out before you get to that point. Kids have strong hearts, so strong that even though it’s probably not a heart problem, it feels like its going to beat right out of his chest! Posted in chest pain | 6 Replies Chest Pain!  Is My Child Having a Heart Attack? Posted on May 4, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply Kids and teens will sometimes have chest pain.  It happens more often than you think.  We see at least 4-5 kids per week in the Emergency Department for complaints of chest pain.  When it happens, parents sometimes freak out.  Is it a heart attack, like happened to Uncle Frim?  Even worse, some kids will even say “My heart hurts” when they mean ”chest pain.”  Talk about causing a freak-out! Teenagers have chest pain the most.  As they grow, they often have aches and sharp pains in their rib cages.  Teens worry about that more because they are already worried about what is happening in their developing bodies- new shapes and sizes, new emotions, and new aches and pains. Here is the good news: chest pain in kids is rarely a heart problem.  Lung problems are unusual too.  The vast majority of aches and pains in the chest are in the chest wall, the ribs and ligaments and cartilage that form the rib cage.  When kids exert their chest wall with coughing or exercising or injury, those parts of the rib cage get sore, just like any other injury.  Sometimes in teenagers a “hot spot” in the chest wall just seems to happen out of the blue. When should you really worry?  The warning signs for lung problems are more obvious: coughing and shortness of breath, fever and fatigue.  Heart problems in kids are rare, and usually don’t cause sudden pain, like in adults.  Heart issues tend to start with progressive weakness, shortness of breath, changes in weight (weight loss or weight gain).  We also pay attention to kids who faint or have deep chest pain when they exercise.  Those kids need to get seen right away.  Finally, some kids have a history of family members who died suddenly at an early age (younger than 40).  Those families can have a rare inherited problem with cardiac rhythm, and the kids in the family can have it. However, if your teen complains of sharp chest pain that is worse when you press on the pain site, hurts more with a deep breath (stretching that hot spot), but is otherwise awake and alert and well and active, don’t panic.  Treat with plenty of ibuprofen, cut back the exercise and stress to let things heal, and it should be gone in about four days.  The vast majority of teens and kids have good hearts.  In more ways than one!

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Post navigation ← Previous Next → Hospitals Are Cool Posted on June 9, 2017 by klfydoctor I think hospitals are cool.  When I was a kid and went to visit someone, I was impressed by the big, maze-like structures, mysterious things going on inside.  The halls were full of strange smells, odd noises, futuristic equipment.  When I got older and entered the profession myself, they became my work home, magnificent buildings dedicated to researching and combating illness and death. Many have the opposite feeling- they hate hospitals.  When I meet friends occasionally at work, I’ll see them twitch and glance about.  ”What’s wrong?” I’ll ask. “Hospitals give me the willies,” they’ll say, looking as if they expect the mummy or Frankenstein monster to pop out of, say, the Radiology suite. I see their point.  Hospitals are places where people go when they’re suffering. You hear moans of pain from rooms, overhead calls for “Code Trauma” and “Code Blue,” and staff talking gravely in hushed tones.  Hospitals are also easy places to get lost in. They grow organically.  Is there a new specialty and technology? Throw up a new wing over here. Need more beds?  Stick an annex there.  They’re maze-like not to purposely confuse outsiders; that’s just how they evolve. Hospitals are certainly safer than in the past.  They’re no longer places where people regularly catch infections, or get the wrong limb sawn off. Initiatives in the last decades have made medicine as safety-conscious as aviation. Checklists, safety-training, and protocols have erased much of the haphazardness of medicine.  Patient safety is now as much of staff education as drawing blood or using the computer. You can help make your kid’s hospital stay safer too.  First, choose a hospital that’s appropriate for kids.  Some hospitals take care of lots of kids, some don’t.  Second, choose an academic hospital- one that’s affiliated with a medical school and trains medical students and residents.  Statistically, patients at teaching hospitals do better- have more accurate diagnoses, go home sooner, and generally get better care.  There is something about that environment, where multiple doctors at various levels of training put their heads together, discuss cases, teach each other, that helps them figure out what’s wrong. In the Emergency Department at Lafayette General, I occasionally interact with one bunch of those doctor teams, the surgeons.  Surgery teams are an odd bunch.  Busy, harassed by nurses and non-surgeons like me, they bustle around in packs of five or six. They come in all sizes, levels of training, and stages of grooming; tall, short, medical students, residents, some with hair and scrubs rumpled like they’re just out of bed, some coiffed and wearing clean, starched lab coats.  Their boss is the Attending, the surgery professor who breezes into patient rooms with authority and bon vivant, reassuring all that they’ve got it managed, their minions scribbling down orders in their wake.  Not the pretty picture seen on Grey’s Anatomy. LIke we discussed above, being a patient in “academic” institutions like Lafayette General or University Hospital and Clinics has advantages.  Patients get better quicker when they have more than one doctor puzzling over their cases, discussing it with each other, researching together.  However, keeping all those doctors straight can be tough for patients, and parents.  Which doctor is which specialist, responsible for which issue? It’s always a good idea for a patient to have an “advocate.”  Best if this person has some medical knowledge, and can keep everything straight.  Usually pediatric patients come with an advocate already- their parents.  However, parents are also emotionally involved with their child’s case, worried sick.  Already overwhelmed, often the parent needs a cool-headed advocate themselves. There’s a lot for a patient, parent, and advocate to keep straight, besides which doctor is responsible for what.  There are multiple medications and tests.  Where are we with the diagnosis, what’s the treatment plan?  And did you wash your hands before touching my child? These are important things to monitor.  Even with computer-controlled drug dispensing, you still want to ensure that your child is getting the right medication and the right dose. The radiology tech comes to pick up your child for xrays- ask why this test, what will we learn from it? So after you and your pediatrician pick your hospital, and your child must stay, have an advocate to help you navigate the complexities of medical care.  And to keep all those characters in scrubs straight.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Fever and Pain Meds Taking Care of Fever and Pain in the Middle of the Night Posted on November 10, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply When the sun goes down, people worry more.  They stay awake at night worrying about their job, their relationships, their finances.  There are few other people awake with whom to talk the worries out.  And when kids get sick with fever or pain at night, the worriers bring their kids to the Emergency Department.  When I ask “Did you give any medicine?” for the ear pain or fever, often they say no, or they did give some but not nearly enough.  And why didn’t you give more?  “I was afraid to.” Fear is the enemy of the parent and the pediatrician at night, and knowledge is the weapon we give to parents to fight that fear.  The first knowledge point, that I repeat again and again in this blog and at work: fever will not hurt your child.  Fever does not cook brains.  Fever and seizure are very rare, and the seizures do not hurt your child either.  Fever is not the enemy, fear of fever is. The second point then is this: give a medicine for the pain and the fever, and give enough.  Most of the time enough medicine will help reduce the fever, take away the pain ,and get you easily through the night where you can see your doctor the next day.  Medicine is not the enemy, fear of the medicine is. Our two pain and fever medicines are acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil).  If you give as much as it says to on the bottle (not less!), and give it at the recommended times, you will be perfectly safe.  If you are not sure of your measurements, call your doctor or the pharmacy.  Your doctor should have someone to talk to at night, and there are 24 hour pharmacies in the area as well.  It is much better to call first and give enough of the right medicine than to come into the Emergency Department and wait for hours for something you could have taken care of at home. When you measure medicines, you need to be sure you are measuring with the right spoon.  “Infant’s” pain and fever medicines come with their own measuring droppers- use only the dropper that came with the bottle- don’t use any other thing to measure those with.  For ”Children’s” medicines that call for teaspoons, use a measuring teaspoon like you would use for cooking.  Don’t use your regular teaspoons-those are often smaller than the measuring spoons and you won’t give enough medicine.  If you are not sure of your spoons, get a measuring syringe from your pharmacy or doctor, and ask about which are the right marks to measure with. Fear is the enemy.  Don’t be afraid of fever and pain.  Don’t be afraid of the medicines, they are designed to be very safe.  And don’t be afraid to call for medicine advice.  We are much happier to answer phone questions about medicine at night than we are about seeing kids who could have been taken care of at home.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Ear Pain Ear Pain in Merry Olde England Posted on June 12, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply My daughter is in London, England, taking a summer college course.  She woke up last Sunday with “the whole left side” of her head hurting, particularly her ear.  She took two ibuprofens and then she and a friend went out in the unfamiliar city looking for medical care.  All the walk-in clinics were closed on Sunday so she ended up at an Emergency Department, what the british call “Accident and Emergency.” An irish nurse took them in, radiating frustration.  Her attitude was “ear pain-this isn’t an emergency!”  However, the young indian doctor was quite kind, diagnosed an ear infection, and prescribed Amoxicillin.  Given that England has a National Health Service paid for by the government, her visit was free.  She had only to pay 8 pounds (about 16 dollars) for her prescription at the “chemist.” This story highlights several points about ear pain in particular and health care in general. First, for ear pain, try some pain medicine.  So many times a mom brings a child to Emergency and I ask, “Did you give anything for pain?” and they say no.  My daughter felt much better after taking the ibuprofen. If the pain had started at night, she would have felt good enough to sleep and find a doctor in the morning.  If you give a decent dose of ibuprofen or tylenol to your child for her pain, give it a half hour to work, you often won’t need to schlep out in the middle of the night.  No one wants to wait in an Emergency waiting room at 2 am when they could have stayed in bed. The second point is England’s more relaxed attitude about medical care.  Note that no walk-in clinics were open on Sunday, in the country’s biggest city!  Brits aren’t clamoring for care 24/7 like americans, and british doctors aren’t working seven days per week.  In an Emergency, their “A and E”s are there to help.  And again, with some pain medicine in your child, you too can wait until Monday to see your doctor about that ear. When my daughter woke up with ear pain that morning, she took two ibuprofen tabs before setting out to find care.  She is an adult, but kids who weigh 90 pounds can take that much.  I had a mom yesterday question me on this- I recommended two ibuprofens for her 12 year-old boy’s ankle pain and she was shocked- TWO tabs??  I did not point out that the child (his football team’s lineman) weighed a hundred pounds more than me. When I see a child in the Emergency Department with ear pain, I ask “Did you give some pain medicine, like ibuprofen or tylenol?”  If mom did, often she didn’t give enough. Many parents are afraid to overdose their child.  Now this is a healthy fear: no one wants to accidentally hurt their child.  However, you do want to take care of their pain too. Kids come in different sizes and have different needs for a dose of medicine that is just enough, but not too much.  We in pediatrics use algebra all day long to calculate drug doses (our math teachers were right- we will have a real-life use for math after all!).  I don’t expect parents to do that math though- it can be tricky.  However, the drug companies put doses-by-weight intructions on the package.  You can use that to know how much to give, but in the companies’ zeal to be safe they sometimes end up under-dosing a bit.  If you really want to know exactly how much to give, call your doctor.  The doctor or nurse can calculate the right amount for you. So if your child wakes up with ear pain, give some pain medicine, and give enough.  Give the medicine a half hour to work and elevate the child’s head on some pillows or on the couch to take pressure off the ear.  Doing this often helps your child go back to sleep so you can wait to see your doctor in the morning.  Save the Emergency Department (or in England, the “Accident and Emergency”) for the emergencies. Posted in Ear Pain | Leave a reply Ears That Go Ouch In The Night Posted on July 3, 2009 by klfydoctor 3 3:30 am: Mom brings the three-year old into the ER.  He awoke screaming with ear pain, crying about “buzzing.”  I look in his ear with the otoscope and see a tan-colored insect, waving its floppy wings against the poor boy’s eardrum. We lay the boy down and I go in with the alligator forceps, which look like skinny scissors with a tiny alligator-like mouth at the end.  The boy is remarkably cooperative given that I am reaching deep in his ear and the fly is still squirming around.  I make a grab with the forceps and come out with only a wing.  Dang! I make another grab and this time only a leg comes away.  Next time another piece.  I look back in with the scope and the bug is now still, but obviously delicate and won’t come out in one piece. “Let’s flush it out,” I tell the nurse and we gather supplies.  We then put a little plastic tube in the ear and flush warm water in with a syringe.  Water pours back out and courses down my hand, carrying the fly body with it.  When I see the flaccid bug wash over me, the brave doctor leaps back about five feet. Ear pain is a common reason for visits to the ER, though ear pain and ear infections are rarely an emergency.  When the child wakes up screaming in pain, though, some parents panic and head out immediately. Most ear pain, unlike our unhappy  child with the bug, is from ear infections.  There are two kinds of ear infections.  The most common winter ear infection is in the middle ear, called “otitis media.”  This is an infection in the inner ear behind the eardrum, and is often treated with antibiotics by mouth.  In the summer, we see a lot of “otitis externa,’ or “swimmer’s ear.”  This is an infection of the skin in the ear canal.  It is called swimmer’s ear because sometimes when water gets in the ear that wet, warm, dark environment loves to grow bacteria.  This is treated with antibiotic ear drops.  Both can be extremely painful.  Imagine inflammation right inside your head! Most ear pain is well treated by over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Over-the-counter ear drops are not very helpful for pain.  Most parents can avoid a time-consuming, expensive ER visit by first giving the child ibuprofen or Tylenol.  Give enough!- some parents are afraid to give the full dose recommended on the bottle, but if they follow the directions they will be very safe.  When in doubt, you can call your doctor’s office (they should have someone to talk to at night) to double-check the dose.  Then give the medicine time to work- a half hour or so. Sitting the child up can help too- this can take pressure off the inflammation inside the ear.  When my son had ear infections he slept sitting up against the couch arm. Then call your doctor first thing in the morning.  If the appointment is in the afternoon, that is ok.  Ear infections hurt, but rarely are serious if treated within a day or two.  Keep the pain medicine coming- that’s ok. Finally, a common misconception among parents is that when a baby pull on her ears or cries when the ears are pressed, that means baby has an infection.  However, ear pulling has little to do with dear pain.  Babies usually pull on their ears for other reasons like curiosity, to comfort themselves, or just because an ear is something convenient to grab (babies like grabbing things.) Next time your child awakes with ear pain, don’t panic and rush in.  Give the pain medicine, prop up your child (babies are best elevated in a car seat or swing strapped in- never on pillows!) and settle in and wait.  A half-hour awake at home is better than a two hour wait in the ER waiting room.

We did everything Dr. Giuffreda talks about below, and my son did fine. Bugs bites and stings are usually no worse than a homework assignment- annoying but basically harmless.  Some crying after a sting (wasps, bees, fire ants), but that’s it. Occasionally an insect bite can cause serious problems.  You should know when a simple ice pack can bring relief and when to visit your doctor, or the Emergency Department. Bee and Wasp Stings: For most kids bee stings are a minor nuisance.  The area may swell, turn red, and be somewhat painful, but that’s it. But bee and wasp stings can be real problems for people who are allergic.  A person can get a localized reaction (swelling, heat, or itching around the site) or a systemic allergic reaction, meaning that the venom affects the whole body. In the case of a systemic reaction the person may break out in hives.  Other more serious symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. More subtle symptoms include weakness, nausea and vomiting, or a feeling of dread.  If a kid has any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately.  If an Epipen is available use it right away.  It’s rare, but severe allergic reactions to bee and wasp stings can be fatal if the person doesn’t get medical help. Mosquito Bites : As you know, Louisiana is Mosquito Country, and mosquitoes hang out anywhere with still water.  Generally they are nothing to worry about.  They bite, you itch, end of story. But sometimes mosquitoes can give people diseases.  You have probably heard of West Nile Virus, which humans can get from mosquitoes.  The good news is that most kids, and any healthy person under age 50, who get West Nile virus get over it without symptoms and never know it.  Less than 1% of the people infected with West Nile become seriously ill. What To Do: For most bug bites and stings, antihistamines like benadryl lessen itching and swelling.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Ibuprofen can ease pain. Use 1% hydrocortisone cream (over-the-counter) for itching too.  If it’s a honeybee sting and you see the stinger, immediately scrape it out with your fingernail.  This lessens your kid’s dose of venom. Wash the bite with soap and water and keep it clean. If it really bothers and you want more immediate relief than benadryl or Tylenol, ice can help.  Ice it for 10 minutes, every few hours or so.  If your child scratches and breaks the skin, you need to prevent infection.  Put on antibiotic ointment like Neosporin and again, keep the site clean and covered with a bandaid. Preventing Bites and Stings: Kids don’t have to sit around and be a sample on the insect buffet.  Take some preventative steps: Avoid mosquitoes by staying away from still pools and ponds where they breed, especially in hot weather.  Pour out standing water from bird baths, buckets, old tires, etc.  Stay inside when mosquitoes are most active (dusk, night, and dawn). Use insect repellent when outdoors camping, hiking, or in the yard. DEET repellents on skin keep away mosquitoes and ticks.  Permethrin repellents are good to put on clothes. In wooded areas, tuck shirts into your pants and long pant legs into socks.  Make your kids wear shoes and socks outside, even if it’s just for a minute. Bees, wasps, and ants can sting unprotected feet. Finally, don’t swat at buzzing insects.  It just swirls the mosquitoes around and can make the real stingers- wasps and bees- feel threatened so they will be more likely to sting.  Just keep away… from the Flying Menace.

Later that afternoon his professor replied- it was just a mistake. My son’s final exam grade had not been entered into the system yet, which triggered the fail mark.  It would be fixed, and my son breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  But it took some time to shake that feeling of dread that haunted him for half the day.  Anxiety can be sticky. Many teens, and elementary school kids too, are plagued by anxiety.  There’s school- worry about grades, fear of bullying, tense relations with teachers.  Home can make a kid anxious too- divorce, yelling, sometimes abuse. Many kids have concerns about their neighborhood- they have to live with the threat of crime, violence, and drug dealers on the corner.  Finally, kids see the news too, and worry about the world.  They hear stories about environmental collapse, threat of deadly epidemics, and the possibility of nuclear armageddon. We are born with the tendency to be anxious.  Anxiety is a motivator cultivated by evolution, keeping us from getting eaten.  Worried about that sabre-toothed tiger eyeing you?  Good, run away!  Even animals as primitive as lizards have anxiety.  Just approach one, watch it twitch and scuttle about, before tearing off. Some kids and adults are better at handling anxiety than others.  And many kids have manifestations of anxiety that look like illness.  That’s when we see them in the Emergency Department.  Sometimes the signs in kids are subtle- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue.  Sometimes they have more concerning symptoms, like chest pain or fainting. And occasionally we see true panic attacks. When I was in high school, worried about getting grades good enough to be a doctor, I failed a french test.  The big red “F” on the paper burned into my brain at first period. But it wasn’t until fifth period that I became shaky, broke out in sweat, and was led sobbing to the nurse.  She called my parents to admonish them about putting too much pressure on me.  My mom replied, “It’s not us!  The stupid doctor thing is all his idea!” Anxiety can make kids short of breath, and thus parents bring them to the Emergency Department. Some are just hyperventilating, but kids with asthma can have true attacks triggered by anxiety.  In fact, in the mid-twentieth century, when medicine was full of freudian theory, many thought asthma was a psychological disorder.  Even in the face of real wheezing, the noise was attributed to patients’ “suppressed cries for help”- wheezing was those cries fighting to get out. Fortunately, asthma is now recognized as true disease. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a panic attack and medical emergencies like asthma.  Both kids have trouble breathing.  Both complain about chest pain and tightness.  And whether their shortness of breath is due to airway narrowing or panic, either kid looks anxious!  Occasionally it can be tough for even doctors to tell panic attacks and asthma apart, despite stethoscopes and oxygen monitoring. How do we manage anxiety?  Kids handle anxiety differently.  Some aren’t bothered by stress, those proverbial ducks letting worries roll off their backs like water.  But some need help.  Counseling can help kids tell the difference between true medical problems like headaches and stomachaches, and those symptoms being triggered by worry. Many don’t recognize when they’re having anxiety, and knowing if you’re anxious, and why, is a big step in coping with it. Counselors can also help kids identify management strategies.  For some, exercise helps “burn off” anxiety.  For others it’s prayer, meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques.  A few kids need medication, to temporarily get them through rough patches as they learn to cope. If you think your child is anxious, talk to them about their feelings, and maybe see their doctor to explore it more.  You want to do that before worry becomes panic attacks, and needing to come see me.

    } We use the latest, state of the art technology in all of our procedures and operations. We believe that this enables us to give our patients the highest quality care with the greatest comfort possible. Technology LGEC uses only the latest, state-of-the-art technology in all of our procedures and treatments. The center is totally furnished with the latest high definition endoscopy equipment  and has been since 2007. This gives our physicians the most experience in the capabilities of this technology and the advantages that it offers to our patients. Additionally, our standards of care enable us to give our patients the highest quality procedures with the greatest possible level of comfort. High Definition Colonoscopy Undergoing a high definition (HD) colonoscopy allows your physician to have an increased field of
vision and depth perception, which reveals lesions, particularly right-sided
flat polyps that could not be identified and removed with standard definition
technology. Another advantage from this increase in polyp detection is that the
patient can go for longer intervals between a recommended repeat colonoscopy
after having a negative HD examination. High Definition Gastroscopy A real advantage in high definition upper endoscopy is the feature called ""Narrow Band Imaging,""
which allows the physician to view more definition in the vascular patterns of
the mucosa. This is especially informative in patients with reflux disease. It identifies abnormal tissue patterns at the esophagogastric junction (the
area where the stomach and esophagus meet) when Barrett's Esophagus is
suspected. This increased definition allows for targeted biopsies to increase
diagnostic accuracy. CRH Hemorrhoid Banding System No more messy
ointments, creams or suppositories. No need for painful or complicated
procedures. We use the proprietary CRH ORegan System ® , which doesnt require
surgery or recovery time. The CRH ORegan System ® is a simple, painless and
highly effective procedure (99.1%) that can be performed in less than a minute.
How simple is it? Our physician will place a tiny rubber band around the base
of the hemorrhoid. The banded tissue then shrinks and falls within day or so,
usually without you noticing. And thats it. Once the hemorrhoid is treated, so
are your symptoms! ERBE Generators Our ERBE electrosurgical
generators are the latest generation featuring ""Smart Technology"". Each
unit has a computer-driven ability to measure the patient's density (evaluating
body weight, hydration, tissue resistance) to deliver the exact amount of electrical
current to provide the optimal tissue effect for the patient's requirement to
accomplish needed therapeutic interventions, such as polyp removal or cautery
of a bleeding site. Automated Reprocessing The endoscopy equipment
used during procedures is cleaned and disinfected by an automated process that
exceeds all required standards for safety and infection control. The technology
verifies and records each stage of the disinfection process and downloads all
of the information to hard-drive storage, creating a permanent record of what
equipment (identified by serial number and patient medical record number) was
used on each patient and verifies that each stage of the process was completed
without disruption or error. Medical Records LGEC's Electronic Medical
Record (EMR) system protects your medical record from being lost or destroyed
by fire, water or any type of disaster. EMR provides consistency of
reporting, availability of records and standardization of all records. It also
allows your physician to view your record from another location (such as the
hospital, his office or residence) if you have a problem at a time when the
center is closed. Home | FAQs | Surveys | Site Search | About Us | Our Physicians | Services | Technology | Patient & Visitor Info | News & Events | Contact Us | Site Map © Copyright 2017, Lafayette General Endoscopy Center.  All rights reserved. Site designed by Bizzuka Healthcare Web Design]"

Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days! Posted in Diarrhea , Vomiting | Leave a reply Vomiting Posted on June 15, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply DODGING VOMIT I have gotten pretty good at dodging vomit over my years as a pediatrician. It only takes once or twice really to learn, after you have been hit. “Gastroenteritis”, also called “stomach viruses,” “stomach flu,” or “rotavirus” is one of the most common kid illnesses. You catch the virus (or occasionally bacteria) from other people’s dirty hands or from food contaminated with the virus. In a day or two the virus “brews” inside you and you start with the vomiting and diarrhea, sometimes fever and headache. Usually the vomiting only lasts half a day or so, then you have four or five or more days of diarrhea. Dehydration is the main way children get into serious trouble. Dehydration is when the body does not have enough water to provide good blood volume. The body’s organs begin to starve for lack of fluids, nutrients, and oxygen. Your kidneys try to hold on to what fluids you have, and you stop making urine. The signs of dehydration then become more obvious as your organs- your brain, your blood, your kidneys- sicken. You get sleepy and harder to arouse, you begin to breathe shallow and fast, your skin gets pale and grayish. Most vomiting can be taken care of at home. If a child vomits, simply wait an hour or two for the stomach to settle down. Then start giving only clear fluids like sports drinks or pedialyte. Pedialyte is the very best to give for babies. If the child vomits again, relax. Wait another hour or two and try a small amount of fluid again. It usually takes a good eight to twelve hours for a child to really start to get dehydrated. When in doubt, call your doctor. If your child has stopped vomiting and is taking clear fluids for six or so hours, then you can restart small amounts of bland food. If the child vomits then, stop for an hour or two and restart the small amounts of clear liquid. If your child only has diarrhea, but is drinking ok, they typically won’t have dehydration. Children tend to absorb enough fluids even with lots of diarrhea. Keep the fluids coming. Also, science has shown that the sooner a child is back on their regular diet, the sooner the diarrhea goes away. So as soon as your child can take food, give it and keep it coming. Even if it looks if it is going “right through,” keep the food coming- your child again will absorb enough to get by.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Insect bites/Boils Hot Times on the Mosquito Coast Posted on June 28, 2013 by klfydoctor 1 Its a great time of year to be a kid- swimming, biking, hiking, camping,and exploring.  TVs, computers, phones, and other screens should be off when the sun is shining, and the kids should be outside playing and exercising.  With the summer rains, it is also a great time of year to be a mosquito. When kids and mosquitoes meet, itchy bumps result.  The problem with itching is that kids scratch.  Sometimes they scratch so much that they break the skin.  Then their dirty, germy hands drive bacteria under the broken skin, and infections begin.  The itching also just plain drives the child nuts.  They can’t sleep, they whine, summer becomes less fun. The best way to take care of mosquito bites is to cut down on the kid’s contact with the buggers.  Make sure your screen doors and windows are closed and don’t have holes, so that the bugs don’t get in to the house and attack at night.  Put mosquito repellent on before they go out to play, especially in the early evening when the weather is best but the mosquitoes are worst. When they do get bites, keep them clean!  Many kids don’t like bathing if they don’t have to, but washing hands and skin before bed prevents infections and soothes skin.  Keep fingernails cut short, so they don’t tear skin as easily when scratching.  If your kid has particularly dry, itchy skin, put moisturizing lotion on after the bath, and be sure to use a moisturizing soap, like Dove or Caress. If your child does scratch a bite until they bleed, be sure to keep that bite clean, and covered.  After washing with soap and water, dress the bite with neosporin and a bandaid. Hydrocortisone or Benadryl cream can take the edge off the itch too.  Finally, ibuprofen and tylenol take the edge off itching, just like they take away pain.  Give some before bedtime if your kid is a ferocious scratcher- that might help them get to sleep. But of course, kids can’t help themselves.  They’ll scratch and scratch sometimes- good luck stopping them!- and get that bite infected.  Sometimes when infection takes, it spreads, gets deep, and causes an abscess.  An abscess, or boil, is a pocket of pus inside a shell of painful inflammation.  This is the body’s attempt to wall in the infection and isolate it.  After the infection is isolated, the abscess comes to the skin surface, ruptures, and lets the infection out.  Myth buster: most abscesses are not caused by spiders.  The “spider bite” of legend is actually pretty rare compared to boils caused by kid-scratching. To prevent abscesses from forming, follow the advice above.  Keep skin clean and soft with daily cool showers or baths.  Use mild, moisturizing soap and moisturizing lotion.  Clean bites and scratches and keep them covered with neosporin and bandages.  Treat the itching with benadryl, hydrocortisone, ibuprofen, or tylenol. Gross-out Alert!  As I wrote the next paragraph, I realized that you, the reader, may be enjoying your Sunday morning coffee.  If you have a weak stomach about boils and pus, maybe go to the funnies page instead: Abscesses and mosquito bites are not emergencies.  As above, abscesses pretty much come to a head, rupture, and heal themselves.  Antibiotics are not needed for most abscesses.  They do hurt and occasionally need help to drain.  But often just scrubbing top of an abscess off with a wash cloth after it has “come to a head” (comes to the surface and the pus is visible through the skin) will help the abscess let go.  Be patient with boils.  It takes a few days for them to mature and rupture.  If you squeeze them over and over before they are ready, you may squeeze infection further into the surrounding tissue and spread it.  If they don’t let go on their own in a few days, that is when to see your doctor. So let your kids play outdoors.  Heck, kick them out!  They need the time away from TVs, computers, video games, and phones, and they certainly need the exercise.  And when they meet mosquitoes and get the itchies, you know what to do. Posted in Insect bites/Boils | 1 Reply Mosquitoes and Boils Posted on June 14, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply It is that time of the year, with the hot weather and the summer rains, when the mosquitoes bloom.  It is also the time when TVs should be off and the kids outside playing with friends, getting exercise, sun, and air.  But when the mosquitoes find the kids, itchy bites result. What does this have to do with the Emergency Department?   Surely people don’t bring their kids to the ED for simple mosquito bites?  Well, they do sometimes, believe it or not.  More importantly however, sometimes kids turn those itches into skin infections and abscesses (also known as Boils).  Then those mosquito bites become a real problem. When kids scratch, they can tear the skin.  We all have a bacteria on our skin called Staphylococcus, or “Staph.”  Scratching and skin breaks can drive that Staph underneath the skin where it can find lots of nutrients and grow and spread.  Your skin fights back with inflammation (redness, swelling, pain, fever). White blood cells collect to fight the infection too, and that makes pus, which builds up into a very painful bubble- the abscess.  Abscesses sometimes need lancing to relieve the pain and pressure and infection.  Occasionally kids need to be in the hospital for IV antibiotics and sometimes surgery to clean up the infection. The best way for parents to take care of this problem is prevention.  Keep kids fingernails cut short to help nails stay clean and keep from tearing skin so badly.  Put bug spray or lotion on your kids before they play outside, especially in the early evening. After the kids are in for the night, bathe them in cool water, especially washing bites, cuts, and scratches with soap and water.  Cover cuts, bites, and scratches with antibiotic ointment and band aids.  Moisturizing lotion can help itchy, dry skin feel better.  Finally, pain medicines like Tylenol or Motrin also take the edge off itching, and can help kids sleep better and scratch less in their sleep. If red spots larger than a quarter coin develop, call your doctor.  Your doctor can help you decide if your child needs antibiotics, a visit to the office, or a visit to the Emergency Department. Its summer- get your kids outside playing with friends and exercising!  Just use the finger nail clippers and bug lotion first!

Posted on February 13, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply I have had several personal fainting episodes in my life, some quite silly.  For example, there was the time in high school biology class:  I was to get a drop of blood from my fingertip to look at blood cells under the microscope.  I guess I was nervous, because when I poked myself with the lancet, no blood came (being nervous will cause a reflex wherein blood is kept out of your extremities).  I thought that was weird, so I poked myself again.  Still no blood.  I poked a third time.  Now I began to get woozy, my vision got spotty, and I got clammy and had to put my head down.  Stabbing yourself again and again is not a natural thing to do to yourself, and my brain gave up and put me down. Even sillier was the time in medical school after I had been up all night in the hospital.  The next morning they had a blood drive in the cafeteria.  I did my part, gave up a pint, and then leapt up and headed for the free cookies and juice.  Funny, I thought as I reached for an oreo, I can’t see.  My vision had blacked out so fast that I did not realize what was happening until people were helping me into a chair like I was a sack of potatoes.  The combination of fatigue, blood loss, and jumping up made it extra hard for my body to pump blood into my head, and down I went. Teenagers, like I was then, faint easily.  First, they have healthy, squishy blood vessels in their legs, unlike we older folks whose vessels have stiffened with age.  This helps blood pool in the legs, away from the head.  Then when a teenager stands up quickly, or stands still for a long time, enough blood stays below that it can’t get up to the brain fast, and the teen passes out.  Teenagers get this even more easily when they don’t drink enough fluids or eat regularly, adding slight dehydration and low blood sugar to the mix.  Finally, being ill with a virus or other infection slows your body’s response time to stresses like being on your feet, and out you go. Fainting is not an emergency.  Fainting is not a seizure. Unlike a seizing patient, the fainter will typically wake up quickly if allowed to lie flat, or at least in a chair with the head below the knees.  Having the head down helps the body get blood back to the brain and wake it up quickly.  Then keep the person down for five minutes, and then sit up and stand up slowly, in stages.  The body needs time to compensate and recover.  I have had kids come in with fainting episodes lasting on and off for fifteen minutes because bystanders stood them up too fast and tried to get them walking around. When do we worry about fainting episodes?  When the patient does not wake up within five minutes.  That may indicate a seizure.  Also, if the patient faints while exercising, when the legs muscles are squeezing blood out as fast as it comes in, that is a sign that the problem may be with the heart’s ability to pump.  Finally, multiple fainting episodes in a week may be because of a more serious problem. But for one fainting episode, don’t panic!  Lay the patient flat, and leave them there.  If they wake up in half a minute, no problem.  Keep them down, sit them up later, give them something to drink, and give them plenty of chance to rest.  Then they may have their own silly story to tell.

Posted on July 11, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply It happens more than you think: the child clutches his belly, cries, rolls around on the floor, in obvious pain.  Mom and Dad get worried- is this appendicitis?   Is something terrible happening to our baby?  They rush to the Emergency Department and about the time they finish registering and get put in a bed, he is all better.  ”Honestly,” the folks tell me, “he was really looking bad!”  I believe you, I tell them, this happens all the time. Belly pain is a common reason for Emergency Department visits, and usually it is because of …constipation?   A recent study in the major journal Pediatrics confirms what we have suspected for years: constipation is the most common diagnosis for kids who come in for abdominal pain.  And I don’t blame the parents for bringing their child in- the pain can be really scary-looking.  It is sometimes so bad that parents worry major surgery is needed. What is happening to cause so much pain?  Simply put, stool builds up inside the intestines and doesn’t pass.  One day the stool is so much or dries out and is so hard, that the intestines cannot move it through, and out.  The intestines push and push, and that is the terrible cramps the child experiences.  Eventually the intestines relax, and the pain goes away.  But the intestines have a job to do, and later they try again, and the pain returns. Why this build up?  Often it is because the child does not use the bathroom enough.  In school-age kids, they don’t want to use the yucky school bathroom and hold it all day. Then they get home, want to play, and get too busy to bother with the bathroom at home.  Also, today’s low fiber diets and low activity levels don’t help.  Fiber helps stool hold on to water and stay soft and mobile.  Kids who run and climb shake the goods down to where it wants to come out.  Kids who sit all day help stool stay put too. When stool stops moving inside, it dries out. By now the keys to constipation prevention should be clear.  First, a healthier, higher fiber diet.  This means a fruit with every meal: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Vegetables with lunch and dinner.  No more white breads.  No more chips and cookies for snacks.  Kids should be eating wheat bread and bran cereals, granola and fiber bars for snacks.  And as you are now hearing again and again, in these days of kids getting fatter and fatter, get them off the couch and moving!  Less TV and video gaming, less sitting with the phone, more play with running and jumping and climbing.  Finally, have a regular time to go, like before school. Guts can be trained to get the job done! We also need to talk about newborn and infant constipation.  Many of the babies I see with worries of constipation are not really constipated.  The new moms come in because baby has not pooped in 3 to 4 days.  I will ask, does the baby poop soft when it does come, and often the answer is yes.  This is normal for babies.  Babies will sometimes go days without stooling, but as long as it is soft, then it is okay.  What if baby seems crampy, pulling up her legs and crying?  This is not constipation, it’s colic.  Colic has little to do with how often baby poops. If the baby’s poop comes out hard though, like rabbit pellets, that is constipation.  The best prevention for constipation, and colic, is breast-feeding.  Breast feeding is so much better for baby than formula in so many ways, and this is just one more reason to breast feed.  Breast milk keeps stool very soft so constipation is quite unlikely.  Breast milk is also much easier on baby’s guts, and therefore colic is less bad too. So as I tell parents day in and day out, week after week, start buying healthier foods.  Don’t buy junk.  Turn off the screens and get those kids up and active.  Getting them moving in that way, gets them moving in the other way too.

    } Lafayette General Endoscopy Center is located in the Burdin Riehl Center on the campus of Lafayette General Medical Center, our corporate partner. This stylish center offers surroundings that are calming and comfortable  it definitely doesn't feel like a medical environment. Even more important than the beautiful surroundings, we offer our patients state-of-the-art technology and the latest advancements available in endoscopy services. We brought high definition (HD) endoscopy to the Acadiana area  being one of the first centers in Louisiana to make this substantial investment. We are totally equipped with the newest HD. This means that our physicians have the most experience in this technology. We have proven, through published research data, that HD increases polyp detection rates during a colonoscopy. Our commitment to our patients is to continually keep pace with the latest techniques and technology to provide the highest quality of care available in our medical specialty. Patient satisfaction, through their experience here at LGEC (as reflected in our Patient Satisfaction Survey results), are consistently high  trending above 99% for each year since the surveys were instituted to get feed-back from patients regarding the care they received from us. It is our hope that the information contained within this website will convince you that we take our motto, ""Excellence in Endoscopy, seriously. We would appreciate the opportunity provide endoscopy services to you and your family.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Education Kids As Infrastructure? Posted on November 7, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply As I write this, elections just happened yesterday, with of course lots of talk about the economy.  Despite the political fighting, one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on: government needs to provide infrastructure.  To have a humming economy, you need good roads and bridges, railroads and air transport, to move people and goods.  You need energy and communication.  So why is a pediatrician writing about railroads and the economy?  Because another key part of infrastructure is education, and that’s kids. The coming generation of workers is as important to the future US economy as good roads and airports.  We will need skilled and educated workers for the high-tech communication, manufacturing, and engineering jobs of the future.  And right now we are on target to getting beat by foreign competition to supply those workers.  While India and China spend less per kid on education than the US, they do volume business.  With hundreds of millions of kids in their education pipelines, they will bring out plenty of crackerjack engineers and scientists.  In a generation, the leaders of innovation, manufacturing, and technology could very well be in Asia, with the United States left as an economic has-been. Not enough US kids, particularly Louisiana kids, are getting the education they need.  Driving I-10 East towards Baton Rouge will tell you that Louisiana is not spending enough on roads.  Driving past Lafayette High and seeing its building will tell you that education is not getting enough money either. Then read about cuts to Louisiana’s college budgets. We must do better to get every child a good schooling; the US will need every kid, rich or poor, black or white, girl or boy, to stay ahead. Good education is not just important to Louisiana’s and our nation’s economies.  It is even more important to the kids themselves.  Kids need good educations to get good jobs.  Kids need good educations to climb out of poverty and ignorance.  There are three pillars of happiness- having love, hope, and work.  The quality of hope and work start way back with the quality of one’s school. At least once per week I see a bright-eyed kid who lives in poverty.  The child is alive with curiosity and intelligence.  As my mom would say, the kid has “a light bulb inside.”  Then I look at the child’s mom.  She is tired.  She has several children and two grinding, menial jobs.  She comes to the Emergency Department though she knows the child’s cough is not an emergency.  However, the doctor’s office was closed when she got off work, or was too busy to see them.  I can guess that this kid is headed for a below-average education in an unhappy neighborhood.  What will happen to that curiosity and intelligence?  It makes me despair. The magic bullet to cure poverty is education.  Education starts with reading.  When I see a poor mom and child with potential, I take time to talk to mom about reading.  I tell her to read a book to him every night.  Talk to him a lot.  Fill his head with words.  Intelligence and happiness in kids is proportional to the amount and diversity of words they hear in infancy and early childhood. The next step in education is pre-school and Head Start.  A good program with early reading and classroom socialization readies a kid for success in school.  Key words in that last sentence are “good program.”  Good pre-schools aren’t cheap.  It costs money to pay for the best pre-school teachers, decent books and toys, and a clean, bright, and safe place to have class. The next steps in a kid’s education are elementary school, high school, and college.  Like in pre-school, good ones cost.  Society, through its government, must be willing to pay the bills.  Nothing good is free and when it comes to quality: you get what you pay for. Good schools are the infrastructure kids need to succeed in life, and those kids will in turn be the infrastructure to make a healthy society and economy.  Now that the election is over, let’s encourage our new governments to make a better investment in those governments’ purpose- investing in the kids that will be our future citizens.

Cancer Center of Acadiana (CCA) at Lafayette General is now among the nationally elite group of cancer care providers recognized as an Accredited Cancer Program. In March 2016, the American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer (CoC) granted three-year accreditation to CCA, with commendation and named it a recipient of its Outstanding Achievement Award. The Cancer Center also benefits from Lafayette General Medical Center’s status as a Major Teaching Hospital.  Residents from LSU’s School of Medicine residency program now rotate through CCA, providing thorough attention and evaluation skills to patients.  Studies show that teaching hospitals can offer better care than non-teaching hospitals. The CoC Accreditation is considered the hallmark of excellence and is awarded to comprehensive cancer care programs that provide high quality, comprehensive and multidisciplinary patient-centered care. Additionally, to earn accreditation, a cancer program must meet 34 CoC quality care standards. These standards include patient access to cancer-related information, education and support. The program must include a cancer registry that collects various data on different cancers, offers lifelong patient follow-up and, most importantly, offers patients quality care close to home. When patients receive care at an accredited facility such as Cancer Center of Acadiana, they have access to onsite laboratory and radiological testing, prevention and early detection. New treatments, genetic counseling and several patient-centered services are also available. The multidisciplinary team of experienced professionals at CCA includes oncologists, oncology nurses, a dietician, genetic counselor, patient educator, patient navigator and social worker. A medical psychologist is also part of the multidisciplinary team of experienced cancer professionals. CCA opened its doors at Lafayette General Medical Center on July 6, 2010 and has been designated a comprehensive community cancer program since 2012.

Posted on November 15, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Yamuna Jaladanki, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. The other day in the ER I saw two kids from the same family, one 11 months old and the other 9 years old.  Mother told me that one had fever, the other fatigue.  Mom also mentioned that one of her other children was tested positive for the flu.  Since both children were exposed to their sibling, we tested them for flu too.  Both were positive.  The whole family was in for a week of misery. It’s that time of year when lots of parents bring their kids to Emergency Departments or Urgent Care Centers with complaints of fever.  Most of the time of the child has common cold or another 2 to 3 day virus.  But sometimes it is the flu.  You and many parents may wonder- what exactly is the flu?  Why is it in the news so much?  Why are we being constantly bothered to get the flu vaccine? What is the flu? People use the word “flu” for many illnesses.  Some say “stomach flu” when they mean a vomiting and diarrhea virus.  Some use “flu” to describe a cough/runny nose/fever virus.  But we in medicine use “flu” as a short word for Influenza, a particularly nasty virus with some special properties. Influenza is a virus that gives its victim fever, and feelings of feverishness and chills.  Kids with flu often have cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and feeling tired.  Some kids may have vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, body aches, and blood-shot eyes. Why is flu so important? Most of the time kids who have flu have mild illness.  Some children are more prone to develop serious complications, like pneumonia, which can sometimes even be fatal.  These are children with asthma, heart problems, or neurological conditions.  For this reason, any child older than six months and people living around children should be vaccinated. Why do we all need the vaccine?  Is it that contagious? Yes, flu is highly contagious, meaning it is easily and quickly spread from person to person. Droplets of cough, sneeze, or even from talking can spread the flu virus from one child or adult to another.  Also touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching one’s own mouth, eyes, or nose can transmit the virus.  Another bad thing about contagiousness is that a person infected can spread the flu one day before symptoms develop.  This means an infected person can be passing the virus around even before he or she knows they have it! What is the normal course of Influenza? This is another nasty thing about the flu- the misery can last a long time, from 5 days to 2 weeks.  Most recover in one to two weeks. What are the serious complications of the flu? Influenza can lead to some bad complications, particularly in vulnerable kids like those with asthma.  These complications include bacterial pneumonia (serious infection of the lung), ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of asthma or heart problems or diabetes. How do you test for flu and treat it? We test for the flu by swabbing for mucus from the child’s nose.  If the kid tests positive, this is one of the few viruses that there are medicines to help, like Tamiflu or Relenza.  They can make the symptoms go away sooner and make the patient less contagious.  But the treatment must be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to help- after that, the medicine won’t help. Another important treatment is fluids.  Kids can become dehydrated from fever and from feeling so bad that they just don’t want to drink.  Some kids also vomit and have diarrhea with the flu.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol can help your child feel better enough to drink.  Also, your doctor can prescribe medicine for the nausea and vomiting. So get you and your kids their influenza vaccine.  Get vaccinated each season, since the virus changes a little each year and new vaccine is needed to keep up.  You can not catch Influenza from the vaccine, but you really can catch it easily from the rest of the world.

The new Medicaid Clinic is open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Appointments are available, but not necessary. The clinic currently accepts AmeriHealth and LA Healthcare Connection, other Medicaid providers are coming soon. “Patient’s shouldn’t use the ER for minor illnesses or injuries,” says Karen Wyble, CEO – St. Martin Hospital.  “This new clinic provides anyone with Medicaid a faster alternative.  Patients will no longer experience an extended wait.” A common misconception is the Emergency Room (ER) treats patients on a “first come first serve” basis.  However, the ER actually treats patients in order of the severity of their condition.  Patients facing life-threatening conditions are seen before those with non-life-threatening conditions, therefore, increasing wait time for many. To schedule an appointment, call (337) 442-6506.  Learn more about SMH’s Medicaid Clinic at StMartinHospital.org .

Posted on October 17, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 In this election time, there is lots of talk about the high cost of government-funded health care- for medicare (for the elderly), and medicaid (for children).  Democrats and Republicans argue about the burden these programs place on government.  However, its not the President, or Democrats, or Republicans, or even Congress as a whole, who is at fault.  The high price of these programs, the high cost of health care itself, is our own fault.  It’s because of you and me, patients and doctors, that health care is so expensive for us and our children. It is our consumerism that is helping drive up the cost of health care.  Our yearning for the newest car, the newest smart phone for our kids in time for Christmas, has spilled over into how we “consume” health care.  We often think of health care the same way we think about other goods and services- more is better, faster is better, more expensive is better.  Have chest pain?  Don’t bother with going to your regular doctor, head to the cardiologist.  Your kid has back pain?  Demand the MRI- that will find the problem, right?  Can’t get seen right away- go the Emergency Department, you don’t need an appointment! Thus we spend more than we should.  Specialists are much more expensive to see than your regular doctor, and often don’t tell you much more about what’s wrong.  Tests are much more expensive than your doctor doing a thorough history and physical; and again are not nearly as good for figuring out your medical problem.  Finally, the Emergency Department is a very expensive place that is designed to take care of a very expensive problem- emergencies.  It is not a good place to go for your back pain, or your kid’s two-week-long cough.  Here is the real kicker: not only are these options more expensive, but their overuse actually makes for worse overall health for us and our kids. The United States spends more per person on health care than any other advanced country in the world.  Yet, we americans and our kids are not nearly as healthy as our foreign brothers and sisters.  Part of our poor health is because of our other consumer passion-eating too much.  However, another big part of our health problem is spending all those health care dollars in the wrong way.  We spend on the expensive stuff, instead of on the stuff that really works- basic prevention and basic medical care. Too much expensive and specialized medicine not only does not help most problems, it can even hurt.  When we see a specialist, the specialist is inclined to do painful and risky tests to look for their particular kind of problem.  When we demand an antibiotic for a cough, the antibiotic can cause side effects.   Too many antibiotics also increase the chance of developing antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria in our bodies and thus worse infections down the line. Instead of demanding the most expensive test, insisting on seeing the specialist, or speeding right to the Emergency Department, we need to regain our faith in our general practitioners- the internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians in their offices.  The vast majority of our medical problems can be easily diagnosed and treated by these unsung heroes of the medical profession.  A doctor who listens carefully to you or your kid’s problem is way better at diagnosing trouble than any test, and is usually a much better listener than the Emergency doctor, who is ready to rush away from your bedside when a real emergency rolls in. It is time for us to go back to a more “old-fashioned” way of “consuming” health care.  We need to go to our regular doctors for health care prevention, as well as for sick care.  We need to listen to their advice about healthy living, and taking care of ourselves when we are sick.  We need to be patient with our illnesses, give them their time to get better, stick with and trust our office practitioners.  This chicken-soup medicine is actually better for us, and already works better for people in other parts of the world.

Hospitalists are doctors and nurse practitioners who care for hospitalized patients only. They do not have their own practice; instead, they dedicate their time exclusively to Lafayette General Health (LGH). LGH has teamed up with Schumacher Clinical Partners to deliver high-quality, comprehensive medical care to our hospitalized patients around the clock.  With the hospitalist team managing hospitalized patients, Acadiana’s primary care physicians can focus on delivering quality care to the community as well as more availability to their patients within their clinics. Our hospitalists coordinate and manage hospital care at the request of primary care physicians, our urgent care clinics and for doctors who do not admit or round at LGH facilities. They also work closely with emergency department physicians allowing for an effective and timely patient care transition.  Schumacher Clinical Partners offer nocturnist physicians and nurse practitioners, as well as telemedicine across LGH. Nocturnists are available at Lafayette General Medical Center because of the high volume of patients.  A nocturnist is a hospitalist who only works overnight, they work in coordination with the other hospitalists to seamlessly transition care from day to night.  Hospitalists are on-call 24/7 and available through telemedicine at other facilities across LGH. The Benefits of Hospitalist Care Our hospitalists are experienced internal medicine and family medicine physicians who are here to serve hospitalized patients. They are always close at hand to consult with specialists, follow up on lab work and tests, and answer questions about your care. They also have an expanded knowledge of acute and chronic diseases most often treated in the hospital setting. Each hospitalist also has a unique understanding of LGH’s processes and procedures, and can easily help you understand what to expect during your stay. This added level of care and availability, uninterrupted by office demands, allows them to follow you more closely and to react to any changes in your condition. Their comprehensive approach and coverage allows for efficient and high quality care, and excellent inpatient satisfaction. What to Expect? After you are established in your room, the hospitalist will meet with you and plan your course of treatment, consulting with other specialists, if necessary. You will have daily visits and evaluations by the hospitalist team members in which they will communicate about your condition, test results and the direction of treatment and care.  As needed, they will also communicate with your family regarding your case and treatment. Hospitalists will have regular communication with your nurses and case managers regarding discharge planning and other needs.  With complete access to the electronic medical record, the team can also access records instantly and ensure medical information is shared and updated appropriately. What Happens at Discharge? When you are ready for discharge, the hospitalist will provide your primary care physician a complete hospital report. This communication provides the discharge diagnosis, current medications, test results and a complete summary of your hospital stay. In addition, they will provide important recommendations for continuing care, any new prescriptions and any test results still pending when you leave. They will also ensure all appropriate follow-up appointments are made. Lafayette General Health and Schumacher Clinical Partners have created a highly effective patient care protocol resulting in superior patient and physician satisfaction, with an effortless transition to the patients' primary care physicians.  With Lafayette General Health’s rapid growth, the Schumacher Hospitalist team is leading the way in meeting the needs of our patient community.

The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning.

Posted on April 5, 2013 by klfydoctor 1 It is discouraging when a parent checks their child into the Emergency Department for a rash.  Rashes are rarely an emergency and should be seen by the child’s regular doctor.  I often go into these patient’s rooms feeling grumpy:  I feel like this parent is misusing the system, coming to the Emergency Department for convenience rather than being patient and waiting to see their doctor.  However, when I see the child covered with rash and scratching away, I get more sympathetic.  I too have sensitive skin, and itching drives me absolutely nuts.  I imagine this little 2 year old guy trying to sleep at night, but his skin is on fire and he is tearing himself up with scratching. Rashes are rarely emergencies, but on the other hand itching is quite miserable.  Itching is particularly bad at night, when the air is dry, and there are no day-time distractions to take the kid’s mind off his itch.  The child is trying to sleep, but the itch won’t let him.  And this is the purpose of this blog: to give parents tools to take care of these problems at home and avoid a time-consuming and expensive Emergency Department visit. The most common reason for kids coming to see me for itching is eczema.  Eczema is a condition where skin is extra-sensitive.  Extra sensitive skin easily itches when irritated.  When it itches, kids scratch.  When they scratch, they make a rash.  Eczema if often called the itch that rashes, rather than the rash that itches. Eczema is partly genetic.  These kids are born with skin that is extra sensitive, and breaks down more easily.  Then that sensitive skin gets irritated.  Many things irritate eczema skin, like dry winter air or air-conditioned air.  Dusty conditions are drying and irritating too.  Some soaps are hard on eczema skin, like Zest, Ivory, Irish Spring, and Dial.  These soaps are so strong that they wash away the natural oils that skin makes to protect itself.  Finally, skin can be irritated by abrasive things like washcloths, synthetic clothes, and things that chafe like jewelry or wet and tight clothing. These things that cause eczema to flare do two things: they dry, or they rub.  And these are the clues to eczema treatment: moisturize, and protect.  The first step in moisturizing is to use a moisturizing soap rather than a drying soap.  Good soaps are Dove, Caress, and Lever.  The next step is using a moisturizing lotion.  This should be smeared all over the child’s itchy dry skin three times daily.  It is especially important that one of those times to put it on is right after the kid takes a bath and dries off.  This ”locks in” the moisture the child’s skin gets from the tub or shower. To avoid rubbing injury to eczematous skin, have your kid wear only loose fitting, 100% cotton clothes.  That way the clothes don’t collect sweat and stay wet, and don’t rub too much.  Washcloths often irritate skin too.  They scrub at the skin, which damages sensitive skin.  Kids with eczema should soap up with their hands or a very soft sponge.  Toweling scrubs skin too.  Kids with sensitive skin should be patted dry with the towel, not scrubbed. Eczema is often helped by medicines like steroid creams.  Steroids are anti-inflammation medicines, and can calm down inflamed, itchy skin.  Steroid creams come in many strengths.  The mildest is over-the-counter hydrocortisone.  Hydrocortisone will calm down most minor, itchy patches.  Medium and high-strength steroids can only be had by a doctor’s prescription.  I prescribe medium-strength steroids, which are pretty strong but do not have the potential to damage skin.  High strength steroids should only be prescribed by dermatologists, since they can harm skin if used improperly. Other good medicines for itching are medicines like tylenol, ibuprofen, and benadryl.  Tylenol and ibuprofen take away pain, and itching is actually a minor type of pain.  Since eczema is an allergy-related sensitivity, benadryl can help with that itch too. So when your child with itchy skin starts scratching and whining at night, try these things to calm and protect the skin.  It that does not work, call your doctor.  Eczema is a chronic condition, and chronic conditions should be seen by the same doctor who knows what has worked and what has not.  Don’t go to the Emergency Department or a walk-in clinic, because you might see different doctors every time, who won’t know your child’s condition.  It is your doctor who will go the extra mile to help your kid with his emergency itching. Posted in Eczema/Dry Skin | 1 Reply The Itch That Rashes Posted on June 14, 2011 by klfydoctor 6 Very few rashes belong in the Emergency Department.  Just about all rashes can wait until the next day to see the doctor.  Parents bring their kids in anyway, often because they are afraid: afraid of infection, allergy, contagiousness, or the rash just plain looks weird.   As we often say here in this blog, it is not an emergency if the child is breathing well, drinking well, alert, and smiling. This time of year we are seeing a lot of eczema, and the moms bring in the kids because of the ferocious itching.  Eczema is a medical term for very sensitive, dry skin.  It is often called the itch that rashes, because that sensitive dry skin itches first, then the kid scratches the heck out of it until it gets red, cracked, bleeding, and weepy. What makes sensitive skin so bad this time of year?  First, the  air conditioning we all live in now is drying, because A/C extracts water from the air when it cools the air.  The colder it is, the dryer it is.  When you see water dripping out of the bottom of an A/C unit, that is the water that should be in the air moisturizing your skin. Secondly, kids get dirtier now that they are out playing more.  Then the soaps they wash with are often too strong, and can wash out the natural oils their skin makes to protect itself.  Examples of drying soaps are Zest, Ivory, Irish Spring, or Dial.  Scrubbing skin with washcloths, and scrubbing dry with towels can damage skin too. Finally, much of eczema is genetic.  Some people are born with sensitive skin, some more sensitive than others.  Some have eczema so bad that even dermatologists and strong medicines barely control the cracking and scarring.  Here is what you can do to make your kid with dry, itchy skin happier until you see their doctor. Turn your A/C unit to 75 degrees.  That should be comfortable for you in shorts and t shirts in the house and a sheet only in bed at night.  Switch to moisturizing soaps like Dove, Caress, or Lever 2000.  Apply moisturizing lotion three times daily, especially after the bath.  Use your hand instead of a wash cloth when bathing your child, and pat dry with the towel instead of scrubbing dry.  Keep your kid’s fingernails trimmed- long, sharp fingernails are better at tearing skin and making itching and infection worse. Finally, for bad dry patches that just won’t heal with this care, see your doctor about medium-strength steroid ointments.  You only need a small ball of ointment (a little bigger than the size of a BB) for each bad patch.  Ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) take the edge off itching, just like they take away pain.  High strength steroid creams, steroid pills or liquids, or other medications should be prescribed only by dermatologists for severe cases. So next time you or your child get a bad itchy rash, try the above things to make skin better.  Before you go to the Emergency Department for a rash, call your doctor.  Unless your doctor says otherwise, rashes can wait for the next appointment.   And find those fingernail clippers!

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Surviving Hospital Stays Hospitals Are Cool Posted on June 9, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply I think hospitals are cool.  When I was a kid and went to visit someone, I was impressed by the big, maze-like structures, mysterious things going on inside.  The halls were full of strange smells, odd noises, futuristic equipment.  When I got older and entered the profession myself, they became my work home, magnificent buildings dedicated to researching and combating illness and death. Many have the opposite feeling- they hate hospitals.  When I meet friends occasionally at work, I’ll see them twitch and glance about.  ”What’s wrong?” I’ll ask. “Hospitals give me the willies,” they’ll say, looking as if they expect the mummy or Frankenstein monster to pop out of, say, the Radiology suite. I see their point.  Hospitals are places where people go when they’re suffering. You hear moans of pain from rooms, overhead calls for “Code Trauma” and “Code Blue,” and staff talking gravely in hushed tones.  Hospitals are also easy places to get lost in. They grow organically.  Is there a new specialty and technology? Throw up a new wing over here. Need more beds?  Stick an annex there.  They’re maze-like not to purposely confuse outsiders; that’s just how they evolve. Hospitals are certainly safer than in the past.  They’re no longer places where people regularly catch infections, or get the wrong limb sawn off. Initiatives in the last decades have made medicine as safety-conscious as aviation. Checklists, safety-training, and protocols have erased much of the haphazardness of medicine.  Patient safety is now as much of staff education as drawing blood or using the computer. You can help make your kid’s hospital stay safer too.  First, choose a hospital that’s appropriate for kids.  Some hospitals take care of lots of kids, some don’t.  Second, choose an academic hospital- one that’s affiliated with a medical school and trains medical students and residents.  Statistically, patients at teaching hospitals do better- have more accurate diagnoses, go home sooner, and generally get better care.  There is something about that environment, where multiple doctors at various levels of training put their heads together, discuss cases, teach each other, that helps them figure out what’s wrong. In the Emergency Department at Lafayette General, I occasionally interact with one bunch of those doctor teams, the surgeons.  Surgery teams are an odd bunch.  Busy, harassed by nurses and non-surgeons like me, they bustle around in packs of five or six. They come in all sizes, levels of training, and stages of grooming; tall, short, medical students, residents, some with hair and scrubs rumpled like they’re just out of bed, some coiffed and wearing clean, starched lab coats.  Their boss is the Attending, the surgery professor who breezes into patient rooms with authority and bon vivant, reassuring all that they’ve got it managed, their minions scribbling down orders in their wake.  Not the pretty picture seen on Grey’s Anatomy. LIke we discussed above, being a patient in “academic” institutions like Lafayette General or University Hospital and Clinics has advantages.  Patients get better quicker when they have more than one doctor puzzling over their cases, discussing it with each other, researching together.  However, keeping all those doctors straight can be tough for patients, and parents.  Which doctor is which specialist, responsible for which issue? It’s always a good idea for a patient to have an “advocate.”  Best if this person has some medical knowledge, and can keep everything straight.  Usually pediatric patients come with an advocate already- their parents.  However, parents are also emotionally involved with their child’s case, worried sick.  Already overwhelmed, often the parent needs a cool-headed advocate themselves. There’s a lot for a patient, parent, and advocate to keep straight, besides which doctor is responsible for what.  There are multiple medications and tests.  Where are we with the diagnosis, what’s the treatment plan?  And did you wash your hands before touching my child? These are important things to monitor.  Even with computer-controlled drug dispensing, you still want to ensure that your child is getting the right medication and the right dose. The radiology tech comes to pick up your child for xrays- ask why this test, what will we learn from it? So after you and your pediatrician pick your hospital, and your child must stay, have an advocate to help you navigate the complexities of medical care.  And to keep all those characters in scrubs straight. Posted in Surviving Hospital Stays | Leave a reply Can Hospitals Make You Sick? Posted on December 29, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply It’s tough to care for friends.  My friend Jennifer had delivered her third baby.  My patient was baby Julia, who had a rough start, needing oxygen for the first days of life.  Jennifer was exhausted from labor, delivery, and worry.  But the fourth day I had good news: “Julia can go home today!,” I said. Jennifer burst into tears.  Puzzled and a little freaked out, I asked  “What’s wrong, Jennifer, what did I say?” “How come Julia can’t come home?” she sobbed.  I then understood that Jennifer had simply mis-heard me. “Sorry if I wasn’t clear, but Julia CAN go home,” I explained, and Jennifer recovered.  Whew! Parents and children often feel vulnerable in hospitals.  A recent article in the BBC News Magazine discussed how hospitals sometimes make you sicker, instead of being places of recovery.  The article stated that of patients in the US admitted to hospitals, 20% have to be re-admitted within a month.  For some reason those patients weren’t healed in the first try. Hospitalization can be stressful, rather than purely healing.  The most obvious stressor is that your child is sick enough to be admitted in the first place.  You’re worried, your kid’s scared, and she’s tired and hurting. Hospitals also cause sleep deprivation, just when you need your sleep the most! Patients are awakened all night for vital signs and medications.  When the patient tries to nap in daytime, interruptions continue: morning blood draws, doctors’ rounds, staff and families chattering away in halls, food carts rumbling back and forth.  It’s hard to get even three to four hours of uninterrupted sleep. There’s also pain, which of course kids hate- needles for blood draws, IVs, and procedures.  Finally, the food: it’s hard to serve hundreds of meals on several floors, hot and delicious, and few hospitals have mastered this. Then they take away your food if you have a procedure- must have an empty stomach for anesthesia! So how can you make your child’s hospital stay safer and more restful?  First, hospitals have been doing their part.  Since a 1990 government report on hospital-acquired infections, Lafayette General and others are policing doctors, nurses,and techs on hand washing.  Hand sanitizer stations are now all over.  Programs to reduce IV and other catheter infections have made infection rates plummet. Surgeries have new rules for safety.  The news used to carry stories of surgeons amputating the wrong leg.  Comedian Dana Carvey (who played Garth in the Wayne’s World movies) was also in the news after his heart surgery. In 1997 he had bypass surgery for a blocked heart vessel.  Unfortunately, after cracking his chest, the surgeon bypassed the wrong vessel.  So Carvey had to undergo a second open heart surgery. Hospitals now have protocols to ensure that we operate on the right patient, on the right part, at the right time. There’s lots you can do to make your child’s hospitalization safer too.  First is to have a patient advocate.  For kids, this is usually the parent.  However, some parents are overwhelmed by their children’s illness and care- tests, medications, therapies, when can we go home, when will my child get better?  Then parents need their own advocate to help sort it all out. The most important thing an advocate can do is remind staff to wash their hands. And their stethoscopes.  Second is to make sure everyone introduces themselves, and keep straight all the players.  Who is the nurse, the doctor in charge, the specialist?  Third, be sure the right therapy is happening to the patient.  What’s this medication you’re giving, what’s it for?  Why this test or procedure, how necessary is it?  Lastly, an advocate can prevent sleep interruptions, like making a sign for the door requesting minimal wake-ups. And the sign should say “please keep quiet in the hall!” Hospital care is complicated, and not without risk.  Hospitals like Lafayette General are doing their part.  But patients and parents need to do their part too, like Dr. Kate Granger. Though Dr. Granger was a doctor, when she became a cancer patient she was treated impersonally, until she started a twitter campaign to get doctors to simply introduce themselves.  You shouldn’t have to go that far, but making a sign for your child’s door is a great start.

This winter we’ve seen nearby outbreaks of Mumps in Arkansas and Texas.  Last week a mother brought her 3 year-old daughter into the Emergency Department worried about just that.  The girl had fever and headache and mom had just heard the news.  Instead the girl turned out to have influenza virus, which causes many of the same symptoms.  But this raised the question: what exactly is the Mumps? Though it sounds like a muppet character, the mumps is an illness caused by a highly contagious virus.  The classic sign of mumps is swollen parotid glands, which are glands at the back of your cheeks.  When they swell you look like a chipmunk. Mumps usually starts with fever, headache, and maybe vomiting.  Symptoms also include cough, runny nose, poor appetite, muscle aches, and generally feeling run down.  Sure sounds like the flu- no wonder that mom was worried! The biggest concern about mumps is that in rare cases it can cause encephalitis, or brain infection and swelling.  In teenagers and adults, it can also cause exquisitely painful swelling of testicles or ovaries.  Before the mumps vaccine was invented in 1967, people were understandably scared of this disease. Now with the MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella) vaccine, mumps has mostly passed into history books, except for the occasional case. If there is a nearby outbreak, what do you do?  First, speak to your doctor.  If your child has concerning symptoms, she can order the mumps blood test.  A big clue to whether your child has the mumps is exposure- was your child around someone with mumps? Figuring this out can be tricky, because it can be weeks after exposure before you begin to have symptoms.  Who remembers where they were two weeks ago- it’s tough enough remembering what you had for lunch yesterday!  So usually when it comes to the individual kid, we count on the classic chipmunk-cheeks to make the diagnosis. How do you get the mumps anyway? Transmission is by respiratory droplets, which means an infected kid coughs and sneezes, or wipes his slimy hands, on his playmates.  The new victims stick those virus-laden droplets on their fingers, into their noses and mouths. So to prevent mumps, kids should do the things to prevent catching other infectious diseases, like colds and stomach viruses: they should wash their hands.  Frequent hand-washing should be taught and encouraged at home and school.  Hand sanitizer dispensers are readily available in public places, and are a reasonable substitute.  I teach kids to wash hands to the Happy Birthday song- if you wash all surfaces of your hands using the amount of time it takes to sing the song, you’ve done a great job of disinfecting. Also use disinfectant wipes to clean household and school surfaces.  Those respiratory droplets and their viruses can linger on tables and doorknobs, and contaminate unsuspecting hands that touch them later.  Teach your kids to cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbows- this keeps grubby hands from infecting surfaces too. If your child gets the mumps, the only treatment is for symptoms- there’s no medicine to make it go away quicker.  Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen for pain and fever.  The chipmunk cheeks or swollen testicles of mumps can really hurt, so don’t skimp on those medicines!  Ice packs can also soothe these sensitive parts.  Most kids and adults get over mumps in about 2 weeks.  Occasionally children need hospitalization for pain control or IV fluids.  If they get encephalitis, they’ll need intensive care to control brain swelling. Vaccination is great protection against mumps.  Kids get their first MMR shot at 12 months-old, and the second before kindergarten.  This vaccine is very safe, much safer than the car ride to the doctor’s to get it!  Some get a mild fever a week after vaccination, but serious complications are quite rare.  Like any vaccine, your child is incredibly more likely to catch and be harmed by mumps, than be harmed by the vaccine. So all concerned moms and dads out there, if your child has flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, headache, fatigue) with swollen cheeks, it might be the mumps!  See your doctor for testing.  But with vaccination, odds are you won’t ever be in this worrisome place. Posted in Measles , Mumps , Vaccines | Leave a reply What The Heck Is Measles Anyway? Posted on July 11, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply It was 5 o’clock, July 2, 1991.  I know the date and time because it was the end of my first 36 hour shift as Chief Resident.  And it was a true 36 hour shift, not a wink of sleep, with sick kids piling into the hospital like we were having a sale.  But finally it was time to sign out to my fellow residents and go home for a quiet supper and some sleep.  Then the Emergency Department called- has anyone up there seen Measles before? I had.  Two years before, in medical school, I had gone to the Philippines for a month for a course in third-world medicine.  In the Philippines vaccinations are a luxury few can afford and I saw lots of diseases we seldom see in the States-measles included.  I went downstairs to the ED, saw the child, and when he opened his mouth, I saw the blue-white spots on the roof of his mouth that clinch it: he had measles.  I didn’t feel sorry for myself that my well-earned break was put off by one more patient; I was elated.  I made a diagnosis no one else could! Measles is in the news a lot lately.  We are having an epidemic- lots of kids are getting the disease this year.  Many parents are refusing to get their kids vaccinated because of fears of injury from the vaccine.  Those unvaccinated kids are vulnerable and when they come in contact with someone infected, often someone who has been in another country, they get infected too. What is the measles?  Measles is a virus that has been with mankind for centuries.  It is a virus that starts off like many cold and flu viruses.  The child starts with a cough, runny nose, and fever.  He might have some red eyes, sore throat, and maybe some vomiting.   Then in about 2 to 3 days a spotty rash develops, and those white spots in the mouth.  The rash starts on the face, then spreads to the torso and then the arms and legs. The whole thing lasts about 10 days before it goes away. So what is so bad about the measles?  Why all the news, why a vaccine in the first place? Well, the bad news is that the measles can be deadly.  Before the late 20th century, measles was a terror for families.  Lots of kids with measles developed bad complications- pneumonia or encephalitis (brain infection).  Many children died. It was common and terrible scene in many households.  The parents and doctors could do little for a badly infected child.  There were no IV fluids, no respiratory support, no antibiotics for pneumonia.  All anyone could do was hold the child’s hand and watch helplessly as he slipped away, comatose and struggling to breathe. As the century progressed, improved nutrition, hygiene, and medical care helped more kids survive. Then in 1963 a vaccine was invented and the world rejoiced- finally children were safe from measles!  But in the span of my lifetime, we in medicine became victims of our own success.  With the near-eradication of measles, the next generations did not learn to fear it.  People began to question- what’s in those shots that you’re putting into my kid? Then in 1998 there was a study that suggested the measles vaccine caused autism. Since then mountains of evidence have refuted that, and the study itself was found to have fraudulent data.  However, the seeds of doubt were planted.  Some parents won’t get their kids vaccinated and that makes for a chink in the armor of our population’s immunity. Pockets of unvaccinated kids are vulnerable to the measles.  And measles is highly contagious- viral particles can hang in the air up to an hour after the infected, coughing patient has left the room. Now we doctors are having to re-learn what measles looks like.  We are having to explain over and over the safety of vaccines, and the threat of disease that history has forgotten. So help us, and help your own kids- keep them vaccinated.  Enjoy one of the benefits of modern science and technology- safety from one of the world’s worst illnesses, once thought gone for good, now threatening to come back.

For Howard, going to Army Boot Camp in World War II was a vacation.  He got to sleep all the way to 6 am!  Three meals per day, daily showers, clean clothes, his own bed! And “work” was playing soldier all day.  He had never had it so easy. As Billy Joel sings, the good ole days weren’t always good.  As far as health goes, there were fewer vaccines, so kids got more bad infections- more meningitis, blood infections, pneumonias.  Cars were less safe- no car seats or even seat belts, so kids got more horrific injuries in crashes. While it wasn’t heaven when I was a kid either, many things were healthier.  With fewer TVs and only a few channels, we spent lots more time outside playing.  We had more recess and P.E. at school, more art, more music, less homework. We had more freedom to explore by foot and bike- the world was less crowded and our parents weren’t afraid of kidnapping. Eating was healthier- more home-cooking, and less junk food and prepared food.  With all that exercise and good food, there was much less obesity. In the old days there were some good child-rearing choices and some bad ones. This raises the question- what choices do we make now when it comes to diet, exercise, and other facets of child-rearing?  What’s good, what’s bad, and what don’t we know yet? When my friends complain about how hard we had it as kids, I think of the Monty Python skit about four guys who trade stories about their childhoods, trying to one-up each other about how rough it was.  In Python style, the tales get progressively more absurd, until they are saying things like “We lived in a brown paper bag in a septic tank,” getting up at 3 am to clean the bag, eat “a handful of cold gravel” for breakfast, go to work at the mill for 14 hours per day, and once back home “Dad would thrash us to sleep with his belt!” I didn’t have it quite that bad growing up, but like we mentioned above, many things are better for kids today than in the “good ole days.”  There are more vaccines to protect kids from deadly diseases.  Cars are safer and car seats protect kids better.  We know more about healthy diets: cooking with less fat, high-fiber foods, buying foods grown locally, and eating less processed food. However, we are unsure of some new things in child-rearing.  One is organized sports. When I was growing up there was little league baseball and football, but most of our exercise was running and biking the neighborhood.  Today kids spend way more time in super-organized sports- select soccer, baseball, volleyball, softball.  Those kids are getting lots of exercise, but we don’t know if the injury toll from repetitive practices and increased intensity is worth it. Another unknown is the price of kids having phones.  It’s easier to stay connected with kids when they are away, and they can access lots of information from the net. But all that time texting and talking instead of experiencing the world around them- is that bad? And if they’re less bored because there’s always a phone game to fill idle time, is that good?  Or is some boredom maybe better, forcing kids to play and think creatively, rather than playing the phone? These are important questions for we parents as we raise kids.  Choosing foods and vaccines and car seats is easy; life-style choices like sports and phones are harder. These are the Advanced Parenting choices not available in the Good Ole Days. Posted in Staying Well | Leave a reply How Not To Get Sick! Posted on July 6, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply Many people, when they tell me their kid is getting sick with a cold, start with “he was outside yesterday without a coat or shoes, and now look at him!”, as if cold air and exposure gave him the illness.  Many people believe that wind in the ears causes ear infections too. Infections like colds, vomiting and diarrhea episodes, and fever episodes, are not from wind or cold air.  These infections are caused by a virus.  A virus is a crystal-shaped, microscopic chemical machine that is passed to the victim by another person.  The sick person coughs a mass of cold viruses onto his hands, or get a diarrhea virus on her hands when changing baby.  Later the dirty hand touches your hand or something your hand touches (a doorknob, faucet handle, counter top, etc.).  Then you put your contaminated hand to your mouth and the virus gets into you.  A day or two later, when the virus has grown enough in you, you start to have symptoms. If you caught a cold virus, you start to cough and have a runny nose.  If you have a stomach virus, you have vomiting and diarrhea.  These are the ways a virus stay alive in the population- it gives you symptoms that turn you into a virus shedding machine.  You spew the virus around you for others around to pick up and the virus’ s children live on in your fellow humans.  Bystanders beware! One of the great inventions of the 1800s was the idea of hand-washing and public health.  Before then, one of every five infants died of an infection before they reached 12 months of age.  Children and adults died more often of infections too.  Armies, with their troops crammed together in camps, lost many more men from disease than battles. Then science discovered that “cleanliness is next to godliness.”  Clean hands became popular.  Cities and army camps started providing clean water and sewage management.  Death rates from infection dropped dramatically.  Many more lives have been saved by city sewer pipes than by antibiotics or vaccines.  What better disease prevention could there be than moving massive amounts of germs away from where people live, eat, and drink? Today the lessons are clear- wash your hands!  Wash them after you go to the bathroom.  Wash them before you eat.  Wash them after you blow your nose, touch someone else, or touch a potentially dirty surface.  We in medicine need to wash our hands before and after we touch every patient.  As a pediatrician, I wade through  a swamp of runny noses and diarrhea every day, yet rarely get sick myself- I wash my hands. Unfortunately doctors and nurses have been notoriously bad at hand washing.  My wife, a pediatric nurse, recalls being appalled at some surgeons who would go from bed to bed, changing dressings, cutting off dirty bandages, and never wash their hands or scissors in between.  It has required an effort from the federal government to crack down on hand-washing in hospitals.  Patients are now encouraged to ask their doctors and nurses to wash their hands.  Signs are posted all over to remind medical workers of hand hygiene and the importance of wearing gloves.  The efforts seem to be working- rates of infections passed around hospitals are coming down. Therefore, thank your governments for clean water, city sewers, and hospital regulation.  Then wash your hands.

Posted on June 30, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Claire Ronkartz, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s a classic medical board question: “A two-year old visiting her grandparents’ is found with some blood pressure pills.  What is the best first step managing this patient?” Though I’ve answered this questions many times on tests, I was still at a loss when it really happened!  My two year-old had discovered some luggage with unsecured medication inside, and was mouthing one when we came upon her. So I called Poison Control (stop reading now and write down this number: 1-800-222-1222). They advised a trip to the Emergency Department, where our girl drank an activated charcoal mix, was watched for some hours, and we went home. Although we thought we had meticulously placed all medications out of reach, in locked containers, accidents still happen.  So when your child begins crawling (or even after!), it’s a good time to think about child-proofing.  From button batteries to cosmetics and talcum powder, a young adult’s first “grown-up” house, when they have kids, can be a house-of-horrors for youngsters.  The newest hazard is laundry-detergent pods. Designed for ease of use by adults, these tasty-looking, colorful gems can burn mouths and throats and eyes, causing vomiting and breathing difficulty. Do they have to make them look so good to eat? The best way to toddler-proof your house is to be a toddler.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl through every square-inch of your house.  Open every cabinet and drawer you can reach, and put every single thing you find in your mouth.  If you don’t dare eat what you grab, it needs to be somewhere safer.  Then from your hands and knees, look up. What’s above you that looks attractive, or even just mildly fun to play with? Find something to climb on- a kitchen step-stool, chair, or ottoman.  Can you push it over and crawl up within reach of what you see?  Grab the boiling pot.  Eat the medication sitting on the counter.  Absurd as this sounds, if it can be done, a toddler has already done so in the past, and will in the future.  Make sure it’s not your’s. Now that you’ve done a decent job of making home safe for your little one, you may feel adventurous and head out for vacation, or maybe just Wal-Mart.  One such trip to the store nearly ended in tragedy for me.  My child launched herself out of the shopping cart in the one second it took to reach for some salad dressing.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed her as she tumbled out head-first!  From then on she was seated and belted in the cart. While that’s not as fun as shopping cart surfing, it may save a trip to the the ER. Going out with toddlers poses a new set of risks than your home.  Perhaps most important when you are out is safety around cars, moving or parked. Every week in the U.S., at least 50 children are backed over in driveways and parking lots. LIttle ones who dart outside to say goodbye often go unseen by a driver when the vehicle is set in motion. Many times the driver is a parent, relative, or neighbor. Following a few simple tips can protect your family from this tragedy.  Teach children that parked cars may move at any time.  Let them know that even if they see the vehicle, the driver may not see them.  Always hold a child’s hand in the parking lot. Teach them never to play in, around, or especially behind any vehicle.  Be especially vigilant when someone else is leaving the house and driving away.  Outside house doors should be toddler-proofed. The world of baby safety can be overwhelming.  And now manufacturers prey on your fears, offering lots of products- toilet bowl locks, outlet plugs, stove knob covers, baby gates, etc.  While some of these items may be helpful, doing the simple things we’ve discussed above goes a long way.  The last thing to do is be prepared for an emergency: post or put in your phone the Poison Control number (again, 1-800-222-1222).  Take a CPR/Heimlich class.  Read the books.  Know the location of your nearest child-capable ER.  And for goodness sake don’t buy those stupid detergent pods. Posted in Poisoning Prevention | Leave a reply Hospitals Are Cool Posted on June 9, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply I think hospitals are cool.  When I was a kid and went to visit someone, I was impressed by the big, maze-like structures, mysterious things going on inside.  The halls were full of strange smells, odd noises, futuristic equipment.  When I got older and entered the profession myself, they became my work home, magnificent buildings dedicated to researching and combating illness and death. Many have the opposite feeling- they hate hospitals.  When I meet friends occasionally at work, I’ll see them twitch and glance about.  ”What’s wrong?” I’ll ask. “Hospitals give me the willies,” they’ll say, looking as if they expect the mummy or Frankenstein monster to pop out of, say, the Radiology suite. I see their point.  Hospitals are places where people go when they’re suffering. You hear moans of pain from rooms, overhead calls for “Code Trauma” and “Code Blue,” and staff talking gravely in hushed tones.  Hospitals are also easy places to get lost in. They grow organically.  Is there a new specialty and technology? Throw up a new wing over here. Need more beds?  Stick an annex there.  They’re maze-like not to purposely confuse outsiders; that’s just how they evolve. Hospitals are certainly safer than in the past.  They’re no longer places where people regularly catch infections, or get the wrong limb sawn off. Initiatives in the last decades have made medicine as safety-conscious as aviation. Checklists, safety-training, and protocols have erased much of the haphazardness of medicine.  Patient safety is now as much of staff education as drawing blood or using the computer. You can help make your kid’s hospital stay safer too.  First, choose a hospital that’s appropriate for kids.  Some hospitals take care of lots of kids, some don’t.  Second, choose an academic hospital- one that’s affiliated with a medical school and trains medical students and residents.  Statistically, patients at teaching hospitals do better- have more accurate diagnoses, go home sooner, and generally get better care.  There is something about that environment, where multiple doctors at various levels of training put their heads together, discuss cases, teach each other, that helps them figure out what’s wrong. In the Emergency Department at Lafayette General, I occasionally interact with one bunch of those doctor teams, the surgeons.  Surgery teams are an odd bunch.  Busy, harassed by nurses and non-surgeons like me, they bustle around in packs of five or six. They come in all sizes, levels of training, and stages of grooming; tall, short, medical students, residents, some with hair and scrubs rumpled like they’re just out of bed, some coiffed and wearing clean, starched lab coats.  Their boss is the Attending, the surgery professor who breezes into patient rooms with authority and bon vivant, reassuring all that they’ve got it managed, their minions scribbling down orders in their wake.  Not the pretty picture seen on Grey’s Anatomy. LIke we discussed above, being a patient in “academic” institutions like Lafayette General or University Hospital and Clinics has advantages.  Patients get better quicker when they have more than one doctor puzzling over their cases, discussing it with each other, researching together.  However, keeping all those doctors straight can be tough for patients, and parents.  Which doctor is which specialist, responsible for which issue? It’s always a good idea for a patient to have an “advocate.”  Best if this person has some medical knowledge, and can keep everything straight.  Usually pediatric patients come with an advocate already- their parents.  However, parents are also emotionally involved with their child’s case, worried sick.  Already overwhelmed, often the parent needs a cool-headed advocate themselves. There’s a lot for a patient, parent, and advocate to keep straight, besides which doctor is responsible for what.  There are multiple medications and tests.  Where are we with the diagnosis, what’s the treatment plan?  And did you wash your hands before touching my child? These are important things to monitor.  Even with computer-controlled drug dispensing, you still want to ensure that your child is getting the right medication and the right dose. The radiology tech comes to pick up your child for xrays- ask why this test, what will we learn from it? So after you and your pediatrician pick your hospital, and your child must stay, have an advocate to help you navigate the complexities of medical care.  And to keep all those characters in scrubs straight. Posted in Surviving Hospital Stays | Leave a reply Real Animals Are Not Cartoons Posted on June 2, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Crystal Davis, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child. Posted in Animal Bites , Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply Drama In Real Life Posted on May 19, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply April 29th was a bad day in Lafayette.  Around midnight at Festival Internationale, two people began arguing.  Possibly fueled by alcohol, the fight escalated, someone pulled a gun, and one person ended up dead, and two injured by stray shots. Interpersonal drama brings many kids to the Emergency Department too, particularly teenagers. Someone says the wrong thing, feelings are hurt, punches are exchanged, and we see the ensuing facial and head injuries.  Teens are particularly vulnerable to these escalations.  Already at an emotional age, with hormones surging, feelings are raw and easily chafed. Teens are also often in the early stages of learning conflict resolution. They are unskilled in managing feelings and arguments without resorting to shouting and violence. Several outside forces can inhibit teens from maturing into rational adults too.  A lot of media these days portrays immature behavior as something fun to watch and emulate. Reality TV consists of knuckleheads gossiping about each other on camera, making wars out of simple disagreements.  Then the assailants confront each other and scream obscenities for the enjoyment of the TV audience.  And the combatants are always so good-looking, just like teens want to be. Social media amplifies drama as well.  When I see fights brewing at festivals, it’s not just two teens having a tiff.  There’s usually a crowd of “friends” swirling around, egging them on, joining the shouting.  With social media, the crowd is even bigger, with unlimited gawkers available through screens and sites, taking sides, trading barbs. Simple arguments become electronically-enabled riots. Some teens learn poor conflict resolution at home too.  When some parents fight, their negotiating skills look like the Jerry Springer show. Rather than a calm discussion of differences, these parents try to intentionally hurt the other’s feelings, verbally “aiming to kill,” instead of speaking respectfully.  When kids grow up living with such behavior, they rarely learn a better way for themselves. Like we discussed above, social media can fuel conflicts between people.  Once on Facebook, I saw a picture of a friend’s teenage son at a party.  His round smiling face, his arms draped around two friends, reminded me of actor Jonah Hill  (a cute Jonah Hill, not the overweight creep he sometimes portrays). So, bonehead that I can be, I said so in a comment. The backlash from he and his parents, and my wife, still makes me cringe with embarrassment. Thus one problem with social media: it’s easier to commit a social faux pas with a keyboard.  When you’re face to face with a person, you naturally edit what you say, to not offend.  There’s non-verbal cues that help you to not say dreadful things. This in-person behavioral check doesn’t operate when interacting online. Secondly, when you’re angry at another person, this social media disconnect makes it easier to intentionally wound.  In World War II, fighter pilots were rarely troubled by killing their enemies, though viciously machine-gunning each other in one-on-one combat.  This was because they concentrated on the other plane, not the pilot inside. Likewise today, it’s easier to say the meanest thing that comes to mind online, because you’re saying it to a machine. But screens are like fighter planes- there’s a real person hidden inside that gets hurt. So how can you counter the forces of Reality TV and on-line depersonalization, that turn your teen into a screaming drama king or queen?  Begin before your child’s a teen. In pre-teen years, games should be played less on screens, and more face-to-face. Board and card games, tag and backyard ball, are all conflict-resolution exercises for kids. Negotiating the rules, playing fair, keeping friends, all happen in those arenas, not in video games. You must also model good behavior yourself.  Parents should have arguments that aren’t death matches, but calm settlings of differences. Feeling wronged and needing vengeance are innate human traits- show your kids how you bypass those cruder motivations, to stay friendly. Finally, texting and messaging are certainly convenient, but elementary school kids should spend more time together in person than on screens. Phone and computer time should be limited, like limiting how much candy kids eat. And explain that there’s real people on the other side of the screen, not computer-generated enemies.  Then it’s easier to avoid comparing someone to Jonah Hill. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Explosive Babies Posted on May 5, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days! Posted in Diarrhea , Vomiting | Leave a reply Throw Like a Girl Posted on April 6, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Corey Gardner, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “You can’t beat me!” yelled Jacob, the ringleader of the third-grade boys who controlled the playground at recess.  He was yelling at me, the scrawny little thing in the ankle-length blue dress with flowers on it. “Oh yes she can, and she will, even in that dress,” countered my friend Reggie.  I stood silently, waiting for the race to start.  Reggie and I had played lots of tag and touch football, he knew my speed, and that no dress would hamper it.  With the distance marked and the rules set, we lined up.  ”Go!”  I took off, blue skirt streaming behind me like a sail. Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. Posted in Play time , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply High Anxiety Posted on March 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My son’s transcript showed he had failed Business Law, a bad start for a kid considering applying to law school for…business law.  After emailing his professor to ask the particulars, he stumbled through the day in a haze of misery.  When he found himself enjoying something- a joke or nice weather, the happiness was quickly extinguished by the thought, “I’ve failed.”  One big worry: how was he going to explain this in a law school interview? Later that afternoon his professor replied- it was just a mistake. My son’s final exam grade had not been entered into the system yet, which triggered the fail mark.  It would be fixed, and my son breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  But it took some time to shake that feeling of dread that haunted him for half the day.  Anxiety can be sticky. Many teens, and elementary school kids too, are plagued by anxiety.  There’s school- worry about grades, fear of bullying, tense relations with teachers.  Home can make a kid anxious too- divorce, yelling, sometimes abuse. Many kids have concerns about their neighborhood- they have to live with the threat of crime, violence, and drug dealers on the corner.  Finally, kids see the news too, and worry about the world.  They hear stories about environmental collapse, threat of deadly epidemics, and the possibility of nuclear armageddon. We are born with the tendency to be anxious.  Anxiety is a motivator cultivated by evolution, keeping us from getting eaten.  Worried about that sabre-toothed tiger eyeing you?  Good, run away!  Even animals as primitive as lizards have anxiety.  Just approach one, watch it twitch and scuttle about, before tearing off. Some kids and adults are better at handling anxiety than others.  And many kids have manifestations of anxiety that look like illness.  That’s when we see them in the Emergency Department.  Sometimes the signs in kids are subtle- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue.  Sometimes they have more concerning symptoms, like chest pain or fainting. And occasionally we see true panic attacks. When I was in high school, worried about getting grades good enough to be a doctor, I failed a french test.  The big red “F” on the paper burned into my brain at first period. But it wasn’t until fifth period that I became shaky, broke out in sweat, and was led sobbing to the nurse.  She called my parents to admonish them about putting too much pressure on me.  My mom replied, “It’s not us!  The stupid doctor thing is all his idea!” Anxiety can make kids short of breath, and thus parents bring them to the Emergency Department. Some are just hyperventilating, but kids with asthma can have true attacks triggered by anxiety.  In fact, in the mid-twentieth century, when medicine was full of freudian theory, many thought asthma was a psychological disorder.  Even in the face of real wheezing, the noise was attributed to patients’ “suppressed cries for help”- wheezing was those cries fighting to get out. Fortunately, asthma is now recognized as true disease. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a panic attack and medical emergencies like asthma.  Both kids have trouble breathing.  Both complain about chest pain and tightness.  And whether their shortness of breath is due to airway narrowing or panic, either kid looks anxious!  Occasionally it can be tough for even doctors to tell panic attacks and asthma apart, despite stethoscopes and oxygen monitoring. How do we manage anxiety?  Kids handle anxiety differently.  Some aren’t bothered by stress, those proverbial ducks letting worries roll off their backs like water.  But some need help.  Counseling can help kids tell the difference between true medical problems like headaches and stomachaches, and those symptoms being triggered by worry. Many don’t recognize when they’re having anxiety, and knowing if you’re anxious, and why, is a big step in coping with it. Counselors can also help kids identify management strategies.  For some, exercise helps “burn off” anxiety.  For others it’s prayer, meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques.  A few kids need medication, to temporarily get them through rough patches as they learn to cope. If you think your child is anxious, talk to them about their feelings, and maybe see their doctor to explore it more.  You want to do that before worry becomes panic attacks, and needing to come see me. Posted in Anxiety | Leave a reply Sore Throats Hurt! Posted on March 10, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chris Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in  Lafayette. Dreaded words at 7 pm on Friday night: “Mommy, Daddy, my throat hurts.”  Doctor’s closed, nowhere to turn.  It’s a common complaint, especially in my house with three girls. You’ve had sore throats yourself, and know-they hurt! Pharyngitis- doctor talk for throat inflammation- accounts for about 12 million office and ER visits yearly.  Pharyngitis has two main causes- viral (about 85% of cases), and bacterial (about 15%).  Many viruses cause sore throats, like adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza (“the flu”).  The most common bacteria is Group A Streptococcus, a.k.a. Strep Throat. It’s hard to tell the difference between strep and viral pharyngitis.  Besides throat pain, both cause headache, fever, and fatigue.  However, viruses tend to have more cough and runny nose.  But having those doesn’t exclude strep! There’s a few rules for doctors to separate the two.  First, strep throat happens mostly after age 3- red throats in babies and toddlers are rarely bacterial.  Second, if the child has a fine-bumpy, sand-papery rash on the trunk and face, that’s the “scarlet fever” of strep. The most important rule is that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it’s tough to differentiate the two without a strep test. The test is a throat swab that indicates if strep bacteria is present. It’s a good test, but not perfect, catching about 85% of strep throats.  Thus your doctor must weigh the symptoms, the exam, AND the strep test to decide if your child has strep.  If it’s strep, he needs an antibiotic.  If it’s viral, antibiotics don’t kill viruses. This is the kicker for parents.  Sore throats hurt, and everyone wants them gone. Many want antibiotics, thinking they will help.  But they won’t stop viruses, and we don’t give unnecessary antibiotics for good reasons.  Antibiotics have side effects- yeast infections, stomach upset, and possibly allergic reactions.  Most importantly, when your body is exposed to antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotics, and when you do need them to fight that bacteria, they won’t work. We’ve all had throat pain, and it’s miserable.  Dr. Hamilton tells of having yearly sore throats as a teenager.  When he got them, he remembers praying for the pain to go, counting the days of misery, and vowing to never again take feeling good for granted! Like we mentioned above, there’s no cure for viral sore throats.  The virus must run it’s course, typically 2 to 4 days.  If it’s a bacterial strep throat, which again is the minority of cases, only then will an antibiotic help.  So how to treat those viral illnesses that your child must “ride out?” Dr. Hamilton doesn’t remember taking medicine for his sore throats, besides throat sprays and lozenges.  And often when we see kids in the Emergency Department, parents haven’t given anything for pain either.  For your child’s sake, please do! There’s two medicines for pain and fever, perfectly safe for kids: Acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).  These come in many forms and flavors to make them easier for kids to take- liquids, chewable tabs; and for toddlers who spit out medicine instead of swallowing, acetaminophen rectal suppositories. No prescription necessary. Many parents, afraid to overdose their kids, don’t give enough medicine for the pain or fever.  Again, it’s quite safe to give what’s advised on the box for your child’s age or weight.  Still unsure?  Call your doctor’s office to double-check dosing. Give lots of fluids to help your kid feel better.  She may not eat much, and that’s okay. Fluids are more important, and she’s not going to starve in a few days.  If she does want food, light meals are best, like grits, oatmeal, or soup.  Popsicles and ice cream can soothe throats too. Keep your child out of school or daycare- don’t let them spread the illness to others. They won’t feel like learning anyway.  If your child has strep, they must stay out of school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, since it’s highly contagious. If your kid keeps getting strep after strep infection, your doctor can refer him to an ENT surgeon for tonsillectomy.  For the vast majority of sore throats though, 2 to 4 days and things will pass.  Push fluids, give pain medicine, and don’t take feeling good for granted again. Posted in Sore throat | Leave a reply Training Dogs and Toddlers Posted on February 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My feisty little poodle, Milou, is all dog.  He’ll fetch endlessly, race around the yard chasing squirrels, and occasionally catch one in a lightning-fast wrestling match. Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog!

The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning.

Why are we seeing more and more cases of it? Reply ↓ Dr. Hamilton on December 23, 2009 at 10:18 am said: Is it a coincidence you should mention autism now?  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the federal health authority on nationwide illness, just came out with a new estimate that 1 in 110 children suffer with some form of autism. Autism, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), is a diagnosis where children have impairments in social interaction and communication, and show repetitive behaviors such as repeating phrases over and over.  In other words, they have trouble expressing emotions and talking with others. There are two reasons why it seems that there more kids diagnosed with autism.  One is that more parents and doctors are aware of the diagnosis, so they recognize it more than before.  The other reason is that there is now a wider spectrum of behavior that is now included in the PDD diagnosis.  Kids with less severe emotional and communication delays are now being diagnosed with “mild” PDD. No one knows what causes autism.  Some kids with Down syndrome or other genetic disorders have it, some don’t.  Some kids who are brilliant have a form of it called Asberger syndrome. It is clear that autism is not caused by vaccines or dental fillings.  The best treatment so far is intensive behavior therapy- the more intensive and early in childhood, the better.  Alternative treatments, particularly medical chelation, are some of the worst forms of medical shamanism inflicted on vulnerable parents.

Posted on January 29, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply One of last year’s fun news stories was a 911 call from a man whose cat wouldn’t let him in his house.  After a three hour stand off, and after the police and 911 operator finished laughing themselves silly, an officer was dispatched and apparently talked the cat down. Similar absurdities happen in Emergency Medicine.  Once when I worked in Baltimore, a mom brought her child in for chapped lips.  Thinking that no one would come to the ED for such a minor thing, I searched for the “hidden agenda,” some underlying worry explaining mom’s thinking.  Like if her Uncle Frim had lip cancer and she feared her son had it too. However, after an exhaustive history, there was no such issue: her son simply had chapped lips. It’s sometimes difficult telling the public when to call 911 or not, and when to bring kids to the Emergency Department or not.  We want to encourage people to get emergency help so they don’t blow off potentially serious issues.  On the other hand, we don’t want the Emergency Department and EMS systems clogged with non-emergencies. Most pediatric ED visits are not emergencies, but families come for many reasons. First, parents get scared for their kids.  They love their kids and when they get sick or hurt, parents sometimes rush for help rather than call their doctor for advice or wait for an appointment. Often parents can’t get their kid seen in the office that day.  An appointment for next week doesn’t help when your child won’t stop vomiting, or needs x-rays.  Sometimes when the parent does call for advice, the mom is told to go to the ED, rather than office staff taking time to talk the situation through, giving advice that could keep the child home. Sometimes when a child gets sick or hurt, a doctor’s office or school is worried about caring for a potential emergency.  They aren’t used to emergencies and don’t want to miss something, or get sued. Almost daily we see kids in the Emergency Department who were in car crashes, seem fine, but the parents want them “checked out.”  You can’t fault this reasoning; they care about their kids and are worried.  However, when the “crash” involves cars backing into each other in a parking lot, and the child was strapped into a car seat, maybe an ED visit is overkill.  Unless the lot has cars speeding into their slots like the Indy 500 pit stop. Too often the ED is used as a walk-in clinic, rather than for true emergencies.  The point of this blog is to inform you about what real emergencies are, what can wait to see the doctor, and what you can take care of at home.  So let’s review common issues appropriate for the ED, and things that are not emergencies. Kids who are short of breath, tugging to breathe, belong in the ED.  Of course bring any children with possible broken bones, cuts that need stitches or won’t stop bleeding, or severe pain. When kids get lethargic (difficult to arouse), they need to get seen.  However, there are gradations of cuts and limb injuries, and lethargy: kids with fever get lethargic, but recover with anti-fever medicines.  If it isn’t obvious if it’s an emergency or not, call the doctor’s office.  If they can’t help, go to the column in this blog to the immediate right side of the page.  Click on your issue to read specifics about what is an emergency, and what can be handled at home. Things that are commonly not emergencies: fever, coughing, rashes.  Fever doesn’t hurt kids- it doesn’t cook their brains and is rarely associated with seizures.  The height of the fever doesn’t correlate with how sick the kid is either: a child with a 104 temperature isn’t sicker than a child with 101.  Coughing also isn’t an emergency- kids cough when they get colds and if they aren’t otherwise short of breath, it can wait.  Again, see the column to the right. This is a busy time of year for the Pediatric Emergency Departments, so use common sense when deciding to visit.  Use your doctor’s call line, or this blog when in doubt.  But if you still can’t decide, bring your child in. Better safe than sorry, but you can leave the chapped lips at home. Posted in Ambulance Calls , Appropriate ER visits , Fever | Leave a reply If You Call 911, Shouldn’t you Listen to your Paramedic? Posted on December 12, 2011 by klfydoctor 1 The following is not an unusual situation:  The paramedics pull up on the scene of an injury.  They assess the patient, and let’s say the patient is a seven year-old girl with a broken leg. Mom: “Can you take her to Regional Medical Center?” Paramedic: “Well ma’am, Regional does not typically take care of kids, and they do not have an orthopedic doctor on call for their Emergency Department today.” Mom: “I want her to go to Regional!” When you call 911, you are calling “help!” in an emergency.  Someone is having bad chest pain, or trouble breathing, or is hurt so bad that they cannot be moved without expert help.  Of course, you should not call 911 when the situation is clearly NOT an emergency-fever, baby who briefly gagged on mucus, fainting spells (and getting an ambulance ride to the hospital does NOT get you ahead of the line for waiting at the Emergency Department- non-emergencies go to the waiting room like everyone else).  When the paramedics show up, the question then arises, where to go? In many towns in Louisiana, there are several choices for hospitals.  What many people don’t know is that each hospital has some capabilities, but not ALL capabilities.  Some hospitals are best for broken legs in children, but those hospitals may not be best if grandma is having a stroke.  Some people choose the hospital they want to go to by preference- they had a good experience at one hospital, they have a relative who works there, they liked the hospital’s ad on TV. In an emergency though, you need to take your paramedic’s advice about where to go.  The participating ambulance services in Louisiana (including Acadian and Med Express) are tied into a state system called LERN-Louisiana Emergency Response Network.  LERN is a separate system from 911.  It is a set of dispatch/call centers that keeps tabs on all participating hospitals’ available surgical services, ICU bed capacities, and CT scan services.  The purpose of LERN is to quickly tell paramedics which hospital nearest to them can handle that patient’s needs, and save the patient precious time that might be needed for survival.  Before LERN, paramedics had to sometimes make two or three time-consuming calls to find a hospital that could manage their patient.  Now, one quick call and the ambulance knows where to go and the receiving hospital knows they are coming. So when you call 911, you need to listen to your paramedic.  He or she knows, from LERN, that maybe Lafayette General is closed to orthopedic injuries because their operating rooms are at full capacity; or that Lourdes’ ICU is full and Uncle Joe should go to the Heart Hospital for his chest pain. If you would like more information about the LERN system, visit them on the web at LERN.La.Gov.  And in an emergency, call 911.  If it is not an emergency, don’t.

The gist of my essay was that learning and playing an instrument requires hard work and concentration akin to learning medicine.  However, while medical practice can drain one’s energy and soul, playing music can restore these, and help the practitoner cope with a career that often involves despair, tragedy, and death. Music has health benefits for the patient as well as the doctor.  Music and our lives are already intertwined.  We listen to music while we work, in our cars, while we exercise, and then when we go out.  Movies, television shows, plays, and video games all have music accompaniments.  It’s no surprise that there are myriad interactions between music and health. The health benefit of music starts with babies, even premature ones.  Infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit are born to a noisy place- the hiss and whir of machines, the babble of doctors and nurses and therapists, the beeping of alarms.  These noises are stressful to babies that should otherwise be hearing a mother’s voice and lullabies. Indeed, researchers have found that playing music to premature infants soothes their vital signs and improves their eating and sleeping patterns. The music also soothes the stressed parents huddling around the isolette. Beyond infancy, music has many other health benefits.  Science has shown that music can help treat depression (though probably not with “death metal”), reduce anxiety in patients before surgery or in the emergency department, and even improve the body’s immune function.  Music sometimes works better than medication to relieve anxiety or chronic pain. Learning music also improves concentration.  Just look at the faces of kids learning a new instrument and you’ll see.  When I was first learning the violin, I used to play with my mouth wide open, partly from concentration, partly so my jaw would hold the instrument under my chin.  I looked like I was being constantly surprised.  My teacher at the time did me one better- she told me she used to drool on her violin, so busy was she with the notes and the fingers and the bow! Music-improved learning starts, like with our premature baby from above, in infancy. Researchers have found that hearing music enhances a baby’s language acquisition.  It seems that infants hear people speaking like they hear music- they listen to patterns and tone rather than listen for meaning.  Only later does the meaning of words and inflection get attached to the sound.  And the more sounds, music or talk, that a baby hears, the faster their brain gets at interpreting the sound. When kids get to school, music remains an important aid to learning.  The National Association for Music Education lists 20 benefits of having music education in school. Here are the ones important to me as an Emergency Department doctor: 1.  Stress Relief- whether the stress is in me, or in the many patients I see with anxiety and depression; music soothes, and playing music soothes even more. 2.  Playing music improves coordination- I was a klutz as a kid and was always getting hurt.  Learning an instrument teaches a kid to concentrate on coordinating his body as much as learning a sport.  Better coordination and fewer accidents mean fewer broken bones and lacerations in the ER. 3.  Playing in a band or orchestra leads to success in society- playing together requires teamwork, and band members learn to get along and belong while making music. Students in band or orchestra are more likely to be successful in life, and less likely to abuse drugs or alcohol. So let’s keep music education strong in schools.  Not every kid can afford private lessons, and learning music helps kids be smarter, healthier, happier, less stressed, and more capable.  That’s certainly as important as math, US history, and football.

Posted on November 3, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply I was worried I had a brain tumor.  That afternoon at work, I began having double vision. I could correct it by tilting my head, but as the day went on I was talking with parents with my head cocked over more and more.  My Fourth Cranial Nerve was malfunctioning, a nerve that controls eye movement, and it was weakening by the hour. I needed an MRI and couldn’t get one where I worked at the time. The next morning I called my internist to get seen, but the receptionist said, “Go see an eye doctor.”  ”You don’t understand,” I explained, “It’s a cranial nerve, not my eye, and I need to get seen.” She still stalled me until I pulled the “doctor” card, insisting I speak to my colleague.  She put me on hold, then came back on: “He said ‘go see an eye doctor.’” I hung up, not believing my ears. Coincidentally I had a check-up scheduled that day with Dr. David Fisher, my optometrist. Fortunately, David knew exactly what was wrong. My vision was already recovering, and he explained that that nerve goes funky occasionally, especially in plumbers who bang their heads on the underside of sinks.  No worries about brain tumors, whew!  Then I found a new internist. Why do doctors, supposedly caring professionals, sometimes act insensitive or downright grumpy?  It starts when applying to medical school.  You need good grades in a tough science curriculum to get in, and nerds don’t always learn people skills, being too busy learning study skills.  Then in medical school you are surrounded by other “medical nerds,” and don’t learn how to relate to non-scientists. Then comes residency.  My father was a seminary professor, and once gave a workshop for hospital chaplains.  He told me of a priest who had observed that the hours are so long and punishing, the apprentice doctors in residency get the humanity “ironed out of them.” After graduating, some regain their hearts, some don’t. All doctors get grumpy.  For me one time, it was a mom who kept interrupting. Her child had a headache, and I was explaining that I didn’t think she had a brain tumor, but needed a CT scan to be sure. But every sentence I started, before I could get to the CT part, mom cut me off with “that’s all stupid, I want a CT.” I finally snapped and shouted, “Shut up, quit interrupting, and I’ll tell you what you want to hear!” Everyone, especially doctors, gets grumpy in “people” professions.  While most patients are nice and polite, some aren’t.  And doctors don’t always start life warm and fuzzy. As we discussed above, medical schools select for academic performers rather than kindly grannies with a twinkle in their eyes.  Then comes the rigors of residency, where long hours and crushing responsibilities turn the nicest guys into ogres. After residency, the hours and the responsibilities don’t quit.  Fatigue is an occupational hazard, and one continues to have to make potentially life-and-death decisions all day. Doctors dread the patient coming back to the hospital, maybe dying, after making a judgement call that turned out wrong.  Dr. Richard Selzer explained this internal struggle best: “Yet he may continue to pretend, at least, that there is nothing to fear, that death will not come, so long as people depend on his authority.  Later, after his patients have left, he may closet himself in his darkened office, sweating and afraid.” So doctors sometimes get snappish, and may seem uncaring about your child’s suffering. Yet worry for patients caused the stress in your doctor in the first place.  So if your kid’s doctor seems grumpy, give him or her a break, a second chance to recover. If he continues to seem uncaring, get a new one. Posted in Becoming a doctor , Picking a Doctor | Leave a reply Trust Your Doctor!  Or not. Posted on October 30, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply All doctors get dogged by patients and parents for missing diagnoses.  I see it when a parent brings their child into the Emergency Department.  The kid has had a cold and fever for a few days, and their regular doctor called it “just a cold.”  When I examine the child, I find an ear infection.  The parent then says something like “Thank God I brought the baby back!  That other So-and-so missed the ear infection!” At this point many doctors, including me, are tempted to take credit for being smarter than their colleague, and let the parents leave with the notion that I am somehow superior. Taking credit for hindsight, however, is unfair to the first doctor.  Diseases progress.  What started as a cough and runny nose virus in the child above can later, after the first visit, develop complications like ear infections or pneumonia.  I too have been complained about when I have diagnosed a cold virus, and later when the child was taken to another doctor, she was then diagnosed with pneumonia.  The family then complains because I “missed the diagnosis,”  even though pneumonia naturally develops later in cold viruses and the child truly had no pneumonia at the time I saw her. Why do some families easily distrust a doctor?  There are several reasons, some because of the family, some because of the doctor.  The first family factor is that families care.  They love their child and when things go wrong they get worried, they get scared, they get angry.  Another factor is that families often know about someone who got sick, the doctor said things will be fine, and the patient went on to have cancer or worse.  Those family stories color any future encounter with a doctor.  Finally, people have come to take their child’s good health for granted and now expect only good outcomes from illness. One hundred years ago, every family was expected to bury a child or two because there were more deadly diseases around, and few effective treatments.  Now when things go wrong in any way, people are shocked and surprised, and angry. Often, doctors don’t help families trust them either.  Doctors often seem too rushed to listen and examine patients carefully, and thoughtfully consider the diagnosis.  Doctors in practice are busy trying to see so many patients in a day, when there are weeks-long waits for patients to get an appointment.  Emergency Department doctors are in a hurry to see patients to clear the way for the next surprise emergency to rush through the doors. Also, a doctor doesn’t usually get into medical school because he is a warm and fuzzy “people person.”  The main criteria for medical school admission is academic ability- being great at science and math.  But school smarts don’t not always go with charm and empathy.  Sure, medical schools are trying to let in fewer Sheldon Cooper types like from the TV show The Big Bang Theory.  But medical schools don’t yet have a really good way to figure out who is going to be a smart and caring doctor, and who will just be a medical nerd. Finally, doctoring is difficult because medicine is a hard discipline.  Disease diagnosis is sometimes complex, and medical science’s understanding of disease and its progression is imperfect.  There is a lot to know, and a lot more that is unknown.  The best doctors get surprised by their own ignorance.  And in a difficult, stressful, and tiring profession, doctors get stressed and tired.  Then your doctor is really not good company. So what do we want in a doctor, so we can trust him or her?  We want a doctor who is really smart and experienced.  We also want that doctor to be caring, to take time to listen to our problem, to be friendly and to like us and to do their best to help us.  Fortunately most doctors are just like that most of the time.  Only seldom is a doctor not smart or not caring.  If your doctor seems ignorant or uncaring every visit, change doctors.  And sometimes you have to give your doctor a break in order to continue to trust him. Or not. Posted in Picking a Doctor | Leave a reply Who Is Your Child’s Doctor? Posted on May 30, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply Every day families bring their kids into the Emergency Department with non-emergencies- runny noses, fevers, rashes, diarrhea.  Many of those times mom is a little embarrassed, and says “I called my doctor and they were booked, and they told me to come here.”  Or worse, the mom might say “My child does not have a doctor.” Having a good doctor for your kid is important.  Then you have a doctor who cares, and listens. That doctor knows your child, and has the child’s past history at her fingertips.  You have a place to go for check-ups,  school physicals, shots, and questions.  If you go to the Emergency Department or a quick care clinic, good luck.  Maybe the doctor there will care or listen, maybe not.  Maybe they know kids, maybe not.  They certainly won’t know your child as well. What if you are a new parent, or new in town?  What if you want to change doctors?  Here is some help to find a good doctor for your kid: 1.  The doctor is “board-certified” in Pediatrics or Family Medicine.  The national boards only certify those who show by testing and credentials that they are keeping up-to-date. 2.  Full-time practice.  It is important that your doctor and his covering partners are available when you need.  The best practices have evening and weekend hours for working parents.  Such practices have doctors with around-the-clock phone availability in case of emergencies. 3.  Competent over-the-phone advice.  Medical advice should be handled by doctors and nurses.  The scheduling secretary should not be giving you advice on the phone.  She is not trained for that. 4.  Reputation: having people recommend a doctor is nice, but one bad comment doesn’t mean the doctor is bad.  Even the best doctor can’t please everyone all of the time.  However, see if you can get a doctor’s recommendation on where to go.  Doctors work with each other all of the time, and know who are the hot shots and who are the slackers. 5.  Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics (FAAP, as in Scott Hamilton, MD, FAAP) or American Academy of Family Physicians.  This means that the doctor is a member of the national professional organization that provides him the most up-to-date information. Given the blitz of advertising of doctor, clinics, and hospitals, these are hints that can help you find a good medical home for your child. When you settle on a doctor for your child, then you really learn if they seem good or not.  The first thing you should notice is that your doctor is a good listener.  Listening to a child’s medical history is important.  As the father of modern medicine, William Osler, said, “Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis.”  85% of diagnoses are made from the history alone.  The physical exam and labs and xrays usually only help to confirm the diagnosis. Listening is a kindness, and other kindnesses should be apparent.  Nice and helpful secretaries and nurses are important.  It makes your experience better, and having them care about you and your child is just plain good medicine too.  These are people who get back to you in a timely fashion with appointments and lab results. Many times I have heard parents say they are changing practices not because of the doctor, but because of the “people in front.” A kind and listening doctor is good, but the doctor who is also a thinker is even better.  Consider this: you are paying your doctor to carefully consider your child’s case.  Your doctor is not just a vending machine for antibiotics and steroids.  You want your doctor to take the time to explore a problem, answer your questions and consider your opinions, and give comprehensive and thoughtful advice.  Now, these things are hard for a doctor to pull off, in this era of doctor shortages, shrinking payments, full practices, and thus reduced times allowed for each office visit.  Your doctor should at least seem to make the effort! So who is your child’s doctor?  Someone board certified?  Has good phone access and good people in the office?  Has hours that fit your work schedule?  Good!  Then you shouldn’t have to come see me.  Unless it is an emergency! Posted in Picking a Doctor | Leave a reply Picking A Doctor For Your Child Posted on March 10, 2010 by klfydoctor 2 Every day several families bring their kids in to the Emergency Department with non-emergencies- runny noses, rashes, diarrhea.  Then many times the mom, perhaps sensing our impatience with the inappropriateness of that visit, state “I called my doctor and they were too booked, and told me to come here.”  Or worse, they might say “I don’t have a doctor for my child.” Having your own doctor for your child is important.  You know you have a doctor who cares, and listens.  That doctor knows your child too, and has all the child’s past history at their fingertips.  You have a place to go for check-ups, sports physicals, shots, and questions.  If you go to an Emergency Department or quick-care clinic, its pot luck.  Maybe the doctor will care and listen well, maybe not.  Maybe they know kids, maybe not.  They certainly won’t know your child well. What if you are a new parent, or new in town?  Or what if you want to change doctors?  Here are the things that help you find a good doctor for your kid: 1.  The doctor is “Board-Certified” in Pediatrics or Family Medicine-  The national boards only certify doctors who have demonstrated through testing and credentials that they are keeping up-to-date in their field. 2.  Full-time Practice- It is important that your doctor, or covering partners, are available as much as possible.  The best practices have evening and weekend hours for working parents.  And of course, the practice should have doctors with around-the-clock phone availability in case of emergencies. 3.  Reputation- it is nice that people you know recommend a doctor, but a bad comment doesn’t necessarily mean the doctor is bad.  Even the best doctor can’t please everyone all of the time.   However, recommendations from other doctors carry a lot of weight.  Doctors work with each other all of the time and know who are the hot-shots and who are the slackers. 4.  Fellows of the American Academy of Pediatrics or American Academy of Family Physicians-  These doctors will have the initials after their name FAAP or FAAFP, as in Scott Hamilton, MD, FAAP.  This designation is icing on the cake of Board Certification.  This means that the doctor is a member of the national professional organization that provides the most up-to-date information in their field.  The AAP and AAFP work with the national boards to develop practice standards.  The AAP and AAFP also are active politically to help governments in the United States and abroad provide the best care for children. 5.  The doctor is a good listener- as I have stated elsewhere in this blog, most diagnoses are made from the patient’s story, so your doctor needs to be a good listener to be a good doctor.   There is an old adage that you would rather have a mean doctor that knows the latest cures than a nice, hand-holding doctor that will kill you through incompetence.  In truth, wouldn’t you rather have both?  Professionalism demands that doctors be both good and kind listeners, and up-to-date in their practice. These days, with blitzes of advertising of doctors, clinics, and hospitals, these are the hints that can help you find a good medical home for your child’s care.

Posted on November 3, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply I was worried I had a brain tumor.  That afternoon at work, I began having double vision. I could correct it by tilting my head, but as the day went on I was talking with parents with my head cocked over more and more.  My Fourth Cranial Nerve was malfunctioning, a nerve that controls eye movement, and it was weakening by the hour. I needed an MRI and couldn’t get one where I worked at the time. The next morning I called my internist to get seen, but the receptionist said, “Go see an eye doctor.”  ”You don’t understand,” I explained, “It’s a cranial nerve, not my eye, and I need to get seen.” She still stalled me until I pulled the “doctor” card, insisting I speak to my colleague.  She put me on hold, then came back on: “He said ‘go see an eye doctor.’” I hung up, not believing my ears. Coincidentally I had a check-up scheduled that day with Dr. David Fisher, my optometrist. Fortunately, David knew exactly what was wrong. My vision was already recovering, and he explained that that nerve goes funky occasionally, especially in plumbers who bang their heads on the underside of sinks.  No worries about brain tumors, whew!  Then I found a new internist. Why do doctors, supposedly caring professionals, sometimes act insensitive or downright grumpy?  It starts when applying to medical school.  You need good grades in a tough science curriculum to get in, and nerds don’t always learn people skills, being too busy learning study skills.  Then in medical school you are surrounded by other “medical nerds,” and don’t learn how to relate to non-scientists. Then comes residency.  My father was a seminary professor, and once gave a workshop for hospital chaplains.  He told me of a priest who had observed that the hours are so long and punishing, the apprentice doctors in residency get the humanity “ironed out of them.” After graduating, some regain their hearts, some don’t. All doctors get grumpy.  For me one time, it was a mom who kept interrupting. Her child had a headache, and I was explaining that I didn’t think she had a brain tumor, but needed a CT scan to be sure. But every sentence I started, before I could get to the CT part, mom cut me off with “that’s all stupid, I want a CT.” I finally snapped and shouted, “Shut up, quit interrupting, and I’ll tell you what you want to hear!” Everyone, especially doctors, gets grumpy in “people” professions.  While most patients are nice and polite, some aren’t.  And doctors don’t always start life warm and fuzzy. As we discussed above, medical schools select for academic performers rather than kindly grannies with a twinkle in their eyes.  Then comes the rigors of residency, where long hours and crushing responsibilities turn the nicest guys into ogres. After residency, the hours and the responsibilities don’t quit.  Fatigue is an occupational hazard, and one continues to have to make potentially life-and-death decisions all day. Doctors dread the patient coming back to the hospital, maybe dying, after making a judgement call that turned out wrong.  Dr. Richard Selzer explained this internal struggle best: “Yet he may continue to pretend, at least, that there is nothing to fear, that death will not come, so long as people depend on his authority.  Later, after his patients have left, he may closet himself in his darkened office, sweating and afraid.” So doctors sometimes get snappish, and may seem uncaring about your child’s suffering. Yet worry for patients caused the stress in your doctor in the first place.  So if your kid’s doctor seems grumpy, give him or her a break, a second chance to recover. If he continues to seem uncaring, get a new one. Posted in Becoming a doctor , Picking a Doctor | Leave a reply Becoming A Doctor Posted on May 20, 2016 by klfydoctor 2 Many kids want to become doctors, and many doctors want their kids to be doctors too. Once I had a great opportunity to show my son how cool it could be.  I spend a week each year in Honduras working in remote mountain villages, and take one of my kids along.  It was the end of the day, we were packing the trucks to head back to town, when I heard shouting from the road, “El doctor, el doctor!” Two villagers were coming up, carrying a makeshift litter of two tree branches draped with blankets. Inside the blankets was an 8 year-old boy, face twisted in pain. Peeling back the covers, I saw a huge chunk of flesh missing from his right thigh.  Excited voices informed us that he had just been bitten by a pig. We unpacked the trucks, moved back into the schoolhouse we had been using, and pushed school tables together to lay him on.  One of the other doctors, an anesthesiologist, injected a nerve block in our patient’s hip to numb his leg.  While I was arranging my surgical tools, I thought, “Great, my boy will see his Dad be a hero,”  like an episode of the TV show MASH. However, as I started working, I noticed my son at the far side of the room, his back to us. When I called him to come see, he said he’d rather not.  Instead of exciting him, the blood, the wound, and the child’s pain made him sick.  So much for Dad The Hero and his son the doctor; my boy was going to go another way. None of my kids want to be a doctor, though they occasionally like the idea of being a doctor.  Many feel that way: it sounds fun to have the prestige and income, to help others in a meaningful way, to have some excitement.  But my kids know better- it takes a lot more, at least 11 years of school and training, than just liking the idea. It takes perseverance.  What helped me was that I loved science (unlike my kids). Studying biology and chemistry was just plain fun.  Also, I wanted to care for others using science, and was undaunted by the long hours.  I wanted adventure too, and medicine promised that. I wanted to be a doctor since sixth grade, but some decide that later.  One resident of mine failed college after his first semester, already not your typical path to an MD!  His dad was a nursing home administrator, and while he was moping about his academic disaster, his dad said, “While you’re doing nothing, come spend time with some of my patients. They’re so lonely.” The first patient he went to see had cancer, as well as being elderly.   He sat down with the man, they started talking, and hours later he was still there.  They became fast friends for years, until the man’s death.  That visit stimulated this resident to continue his dream of patient care.  He became a paramedic, and after several years with EMS, got serious about college, and went on to medical school.  In 4 weeks he graduates residency to be a full-fledged doctor. Though we discussed above that becoming a doctor means loving science, it’s really about taking care of people.  Often that ideal is lost in the rigors of the eleven year training, where student live and breathe medicine and science.  Patients become subjects of study, rather than people in need. But immersion in medicine, becoming a “medical nerd,” is pretty much required.  First, students need all A’s and B’s in four years of college, usually in a science degree.  Then, only one-third of medical school applicants get accepted to go on. The next four years in medical school are even harder- 50-plus hours per week of class, study, and hospital time, instead of the 15 to 18 hours class time in college. After medical school comes residency, where the “resident” doctor works 80-hour weeks apprenticing in a specialty. Residency takes three years for the basic specialties (pediatrics, adult medicine, family practice), more years for OB/GYN, surgery, or subspecialties. But if you are not dissuaded, and want a life of profound duty and fulfillment, service and excitement, and have a capacity for delayed gratification (I was 29 years old when I finished school and training), go for it!  Just don’t forget about your patients.

Posted on January 29, 2015 by klfydoctor 1 I just returned from my yearly medical mission in Honduras.  And I thought I had gotten away with it- no missed flights, no lost equipment, no bad stomach bugs for the team.  But the next morning I sat down at work and YOW- my lower back clenched up!  This happens every couple of years for me, particularly when I have been abusing my back.  All week in Honduras I was hauling duffels, riding rocky mountain roads in old pick-up trucks, hunching over hundreds of patients.  The next few days I walked like a crippled cowboy until things loosened up. Every week at home I see a kid with back pain too; it’s not just for old guys like me. Sometimes it’s a dramatic injury, like the weight-lifter whose back went POP! after dead-lifting 315 lbs, or the cheerleader who fell off the pyramid onto her tailbone.  Sometimes it’s a dancer who only strains a muscle but keeps on dancing, aggravating the injury further. Teenagers also abuse their backs outside of sports.  They slouch.  They slouch in school chairs.  They slouch in the car. They slouch all day on the couch at home. Then they go back to school and haul a dump-truck load of books in their school bags. When a teen’s back begins to hurt, sometimes they complain, sometimes not.  They blow it off and continue to strain their spines, or continue their sports.  They may take an ibuprofen or two.  Maybe the ibuprofen works, maybe not, because they only use it sporadically, and they keep on slouching and playing. Eventually they tell somebody and get brought in. So how to ease that angry back?  For me, it was two ibuprofens around the clock, and my return to Red’s gym was delayed a week.  At work I sat upright in my ergonomic chair, and slept with a pillow under my knees.  And these things are the keys to easing your teen’s back pain too. Like we detailed above, teens will continue to abuse their backs despite the pain.  Many kids (adults too) do not put two-and-two together when it comes to caring for their spines, or any other joints for that matter.  Their backs hurt, but they still slouch.  Their knees hurt, but they still play basketball or soccer.  They play hurt, and sit hurt too. Thus is the first clue to taking care of a sore back- stop abusing it!  Take the strain off by sitting upright with feet flat on the floor, thighs flat on the chair, spine tucked against the chair back.  If the chair does not have a lower back, or “lumbar,” support, use a pillow to put a slight arch in your back.  When in bed take strain off your back by sleeping with flexed knees.  That means putting a pillow under your knees when on your back, and a pillow between your knees when lying on your side.  Standing strains the back too, but you can ease it by putting one foot up on a step. And for goodness’ sake take a break from sports!  I’m all for sports and exercise in kids, but if you’ve hurt something, you’ve got to let it heal.  That means no basketball, P.E., dance, or running.  When professional athletes get hurt, do they keep playing?  No, they go on the Disabled List and start therapy.  No pros want to kill the golden goose, which is their million-dollar athletic ability. Pain medicine helps.  Ibuprofen or tylenol can take the edge off back pain, as long as you take enough and start caring for your back.  You can ice your back too, just like you’d ice any injured joint.  An ice pack against your lower spine, ten minutes at a time, three times daily, can ease pain and inflammation. If rest, medicine, and ice don’t make things better, see your doctor.  Some kids who have been abusing their backs for a long time need physical therapy.  Sometimes they need tests to be sure that their pain is not from something else besides muscle strain.  But often, kids just need to sit up straight.  You may only be 16, but take care of your back so that it takes care of you.

The only two times in my career a parent has outright yelled in my face were when I didn’t prescribe antibiotics. Today’s guest columnist, Dr. Seth Koster, explains viruses and when antibiotics are needed.  Dr. Koster is a resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. A lot of parents aren’t sure what to expect with their first child.  Did he just cough?  He sneezed twice, is that bad?  Do I need to go to the doctor?  Some things are common, yet seem complicated.  Let’s talk about some common conditions that are usually a virus that get better with a little TLC, and some “red flags,” things that need to be checked right away. I think my kid is wheezing, should I bring her in? Many parents hear baby make funny sounds, and call it wheezing.  Sometimes the sound they are trying to describe is the rattling of nose congestion.  True wheezing that we worry about is a whistling, gaspy tone in the lungs.  Either way you would be safe calling your doctor for a next day appointment if the wheezing doesn’t get better.  But if your child seems to be breathing fast or is having to pull in breaths, then he needs to be seen right away. The vast majority of colds and coughs are viral.  Even with true wheezing, this is usually a virus and not pneumonia, and antibiotics won’t help.  Hundreds of viruses cause coughs and runny noses and wheezing: adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and many more.  Antibiotics do not kill viruses.  What kids with these need is supportive care, meaning fluids and fever and pain medicine.  If they get really sick with wheezing and shortness of breath, they may need IV fluids, breathing treatments, and observation in the hospital. My child is pulling at his ears.  Does she need antibiotics? Most of the time “ear pulling” is not from ear infection.  Kids pull on their ears when they are stuffy from congestion, if they have a headache, or some kids just play with their ears.  If the child is not fussy and doesn’t have fever, they don’t have to see the doctor. What if she has fever-rush her to the Emergency Department?  No.  Ear infections may hurt, but that can be controlled with ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) for fever and pain.  Over 70% of ear infections are viral and don’t need antibiotics.  That being said, if your child is having ear pain and fever, see your doctor.  After an exam the doctor can decide if antibiotics or pain drops will help.  But ear pain is rarely an emergency that can’t wait until tomorrow. My child is vomiting, what to do? Whether vomiting needs to be checked out by the doctor depends on how much and how long.  Some kids are brought in to the ER when they vomit only once or twice, or only for a few hours. However, that is not enough time for a child to get dehydrated, and most will quit vomiting soon after. A simple “stomach virus” is usually not serious and will resolve in 1-3 days.  If the child vomits, wait an hour for his stomach to settle, then start clear liquids (gatorade, dilute juice, pedialyte), sipping slowly.  After the child has stopped vomiting for about 6 hours, you can start bland foods.  No fast food.  If your child has a fever, ibuprofen or acetaminophen will help with that. For most stomach illnesses antibiotics will not help, and even make vomiting and diarrhea worse. So when does your child need to be seen?  If she is having worsening belly pain, that is worrisome.  If your child is vomiting all day or is vomiting blood or dark green, bring them in.  If your kid is having diarrhea for more than a week, that is one of the few times an antibiotic may help, since that may be a bacterial illness and not a virus. Your child will get sick, there’s no avoiding it.  You usually don’t need antibiotics to treat them.  Most of the time your kid just needs rest, fluids, ibuprofen, and TLC. Posted in Antibiotic Usage , Colds in Babies | Leave a reply A Difficult Case of C. Difficile Posted on December 11, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply I took care of a teenager this past year who suffered from too many antibiotics.  Her doctor originally thought she had a skin infection and put her on the first antibiotic course.  The skin did not improve, so he put her on a second course.  When the skin was still no better, he sent her to the Emergency Department.  Here she was put on a third, even more powerful antibiotic.  Her skin still did not improve, but she developed diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, and terrible cramps. Her diarrhea and cramps lasted almost three weeks before we figured out that she had a bowel infection called “C. Difficile.”  C. Difficile is a bacteria that lives in your colon, in harmony with the other kinds of bacteria there.  If you get too many antibiotics though, the antibiotics wipe out many of the other bacteria that compete with C. Difficile, and the C. Difficile takes over.  When it takes over, you get the painful and unpleasant symptoms of our teen above.  After two more rounds of antibiotics aimed at the C. Difficile, the girl finally got better.  Except for her skin, which probably wasn’t infected in the first place. Antibiotic overuse is a big problem in modern medicine.  Antibiotics are prescribed too often for conditions they can’t help.  People are most often infected by viruses, which antibiotics do not kill.  Viruses cause the vast majority of coughs and runny noses, fevers, sore throats, and even most sinus and ear infections.  There is no cure for viruses except for time; waiting the three or four days it will take for the patient’s immune system to clean out the virus.  However, patients or patients’ families often pressure doctors to prescribe the unnecessary antibiotics: “You’ve got to do something!” In turn, doctors feel that pressure and write the prescription.  What can it hurt?, we think.  What if it really is a bacterial infection, which antibiotics do cure, and we are late in prescribing the antibiotic and the patient gets sicker?  This is what we doctors often say to ourselves to make it easier on our consciences when we over-prescribe antibiotics. So how can antibiotics be bad?  Just ask our teenager in the case I just described.  Antibiotics are drugs, just like adrenalin or steroids or heart medicines.  They can be helpful when used properly, but they also have side effects.  People develop allergic reactions to antibiotics, occasionally severe and life-threatening reactions.  Antibiotics can also change the healthy balance of bacteria in a person’s bowels (like our teenager), or in the mouth, leading to painful consequences. Even worse, too many antibiotics in a person, or in the environment as a whole, lead to bacteria developing resistance to the antibiotics.  Bacteria are living things, and their populations are constantly evolving.  One of their evolutionary abilities is to develop and share resistance to chemicals that can harm them, like antibiotics.  Some bacteria populations, like Enterococcus or Staph Aureus, have developed resistance to so many antibiotics that people infected with them have a hard time being cured.  There are only a few antibiotics left that can wipe out those bugs, and those antibiotics are so strong that they really have some nasty side effects, and can only be given in the hospital through an IV catheter in a vein. Doctors and scientists worry that there might come a day when all bacteria become resistant to all antibiotics, and we will be back to the days before antibiotics.  In those olden days, people died of pneumonia and strep throat.  Ear and sinus infections sometimes caused terrible complications where the infections ate into the brain cavity.  Just about all doctors’ professional organizations, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, have campaigns to encourage doctors and patients to be more judicious in their use of antibiotics, so that antibiotic resistance does not get out of control. So join doctors and scientists in advocating the proper use of antibiotics.  Do your part to prevent antibiotic resistance by not insisting on an antibiotic if your doctor says it is not necessary.  That is not only better for us all in the long run, it is just plain better medicine. Posted in Antibiotic Usage | Leave a reply Give Me Antibiotics!  No? Posted on August 31, 2009 by klfydoctor 2 Every pediatrician has come to know The Look.  The parent’s face falls.  They are obviously disappointed, sometimes angry.  It happens when the parent came in expecting that the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic for their child’s illness, only to be told an antibiotic will not help.  There are only two times in my 17 year career that I have been yelled at and insulted to my face by a parent.  Were they at times of terrible stress and tragedy, a diagnosis of cancer or a death?  No, they were both when I diagnosed a viral illness in a smiling, obviously not very sick child and told the parent that an antibiotic was not necessary. This October the national Center for Disease Control (CDC) is declaring a Get Smart About Antibiotics week.  From October 5 to 11 they will be having a media campaign to promote better public knowledge about when patients need antibiotics, and when they don’t.  October is a good time for this, given that child illnesses will be rising as kids swap germs at school, and the flu season starts (as if it already hasn’t!).  Many kids will get sick and their parents will be hoping for something to make them better. Most of those illnesses will be caused by a virus, and antibiotics don’t kill viruses.  Viruses are those bugs that cause runny noses (even green runny noses), coughs, vomiting and diarrhea, most sore throats, and most fevers.  These illnesses get better on their own in 3 to 4 days.  Their treatment is to ease the symptoms with vaporizers, fluids, fever and pain medicine, and such.  For more information on these, see the Categories column on the right side of this page. Antibiotics are for treating infections caused by bacteria.  These are the bugs that cause some ear infections, skin infections and boils, Strep throat, certain pneumonias, and bladder infections. So many parents wonder “why not just give an antibiotic, just in case?  What’s the harm?”  Many doctors hate to disappoint parents, give in to this argument, and prescribe unnecessary antibiotics when pressured by families.  Well, here is the harm:  antibiotics are not entirely safe drugs.  Patients can have allergic reactions to antibiotics, sometimes severe reactions.  Sometimes if a patient gets an antibiotic and then stays sick, the antibiotic can negate the ability of later tests to tell the diagnosis. The biggest reason not to give antibiotics is the risk of bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics.  This has been happening for decades and has given rise to bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics.   Some patients get very sick with these super-resistant bugs like MRSA and VRE.  The newer antibiotics to attack those infections are so strong that the patient can get sick from the antibiotic too. Experts worry that the day may come when all bacteria develop resistance to all antibiotics.  This is why the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and other expert groups are anxious to get doctors to stop prescribing unnecessary antibiotics; and to get parents to stop pressuring their doctors for them. Next time your doctor says your child has a virus, be patient.  Give it a few days of fever medicine, vaporizers and throat sprays, chicken soup and honey.  If your child is not better then, it is fair then to call your doctor about getting another look. Feel free to comment about your experiences with viruses and antibiotic disappointments!

    } Colorectal Cancer Symptoms It is important that anyone at any age who has symptoms of colorectal cancer be fully evaluated with a colonoscopy to rule out cancer. Watching and waiting is not an acceptable option. Remember, colorectal cancer can be present without any symptoms at all.  So, screening is important to finding cancer early, when it is most curable. Symptoms can include: A change in bowel habits  constipation or diarrhea that lasts more than a couple of weeks. A feeling that the bowel does not empty completely. Bright red or very dark blood in the stool, black stools that may indicate hidden blood. Stools that look narrower or thinner than normal. Abdominal discomfort such as frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness or cramps. Weight loss with no known explanation. Constant tiredness or fatigue. Unexplained anemia (low number of red blood cells).

} How do I make an appointment for an examination at Lafayette General Endoscopy Center? How does getting a colonoscopy keep someone from getting colon cancer? How often does a person need a colonscopy? I have heard some frightening stories about pain during these types of examinations that prevent me from having a colonoscopy.  What should I do? I have heartburn a lot. Could this be serious? Billing FAQ's How much will I owe for my procedure? I paid what I was told to pay on the day of the procedure, so why am I getting an additional bill? What if I paid you more than my insurance company said I owed you? Who provides Anesthesia services and what should I excpect? Q: How do I make an appointment for an examination at Lafayette General Endoscopy Center? A:         You can call the office of our physician partners directly to schedule an appointment  you do not need a referral.  To schedule with Dr. Abshire or Dr. Arterburn, the office number is (337) 232-6697.  The office number for Dr. Noel is (337) 235-9779. Back to Top Q: How does getting a colonoscopy keep someone from getting colon cancer? A:         A colonoscopy allows a physician to examine the lining of your colon. This allows the physician to identify and remove any lesions or growths, called polyps, that grow on the colon walls and can become malignant over time. Removing these growths before they reach this advanced stage prevents colon cancer. Back to Top Q: How often does a person need a colonscopy? A:         Recommended guidelines suggest a screening exam at age 50, if you are a person at standard risk for colon cancer. If no polyps or abnormalities are found at that time, your physician will suggest a repeat colonoscopy in 7 - 10 years. If polyps are found, the pathology report on the removed tissue determines your future examination intervals. Back to Top Q: I have heard some frightening stories about pain during these types of examinations that prevent me from having a colonoscopy.  What should I do? A:         At LGEC, we use the highest quality sedation available for outpatient endoscopy today.  This sedation is given to our patients and monitored during their procedure by a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist under the direction of an Anesthesiologist  the safest standard of care available in the industry.  The patient slowly goes to sleep when the medication is administered through an IV; feels nothing during the procedure; and wakes up in recovery after the exam is over.  Our patients report an extremely high satisfaction rate with the sedation they receive at the facility. You do not need to worry about experiencing pain. Back to Top Q: I have heartburn a lot. Could this be serious? A:         Heartburn is a signal that acid from the stomach is washing back up into the esophagus.  The stomach has thick, muscular walls that can withstand the acid necessary for the digestion of food.  The esophagus has thin walls that do not provide this protection against acid.  Frequent exposure to acid damages the lining of the esophagus and, over time, can cause a condition called Barretts Esophagus.  This damage can cause a malignancy in the effected area.  It is important to see a physician for medication and diet recommendations, as well as lifestyle changes, to improve this situation.  Your physician may also suggest a gastroscope, an examination which allows a visual inspection of the lining of your esophagus and stomach to determine if damage to the esophagus has taken place.  Biopsies of the area may be taken to evaluate the extent of tissue injury.   Patients with an established diagnosis of Barretts should be followed closely with surveillance biopsies at regular intervals. Back to Top Billing FAQ's Q: How much will I owe for my procedure? A:         Our facility will call your insurance company and get estimated benefits for your procedure. We will then give you an estimated quote of the remaining patient financial responsibility prior to you coming in, either by phone or by mail. In addition to the quoted facility and physician charges, you will receive separate billings for anesthesia services and possible pathology services, if indicated. The anesthesia and pathology services will bill directly from their offices. LGEC requires payment at the time of service. If financial arrangements are requested, they must be established prior to your procedure. We accept the following payment options: cash, check, VISA and MasterCard. Back to Top Q: I paid what I was told to pay on the day of the procedure, so why am I getting an additional bill? A: When we request pre-certification benefits from your insurance company, the quote is given for a basic procedure. Any therapeutic interventions required, such as biopsies, polyp removal, dilations, etc., are additional charges and change the cost of your procedure. Although this will increase the payable amount by your insurance company, it may also increase your payable portion. In that event, you will receive a bill for your remaining balance. Back to Top Q: What if I paid you more than my insurance company said I owed you? A: In the event that your insurance company pays more for your procedure than initially quoted, there may be an overpayment on your account. This money will be refunded to you once all insurance payments have been received and posted. We run refund reports at the end of each month and refund any money due to patients at that time. Back to Top Q: Who provides Anesthesia services and what should I excpect? A:         Anesthesia at LGEC is provided by Parish Anesthesia Services. It is likely that two anesthesia providers will be involved in your care; an Anesthesiologist and a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). Depending on the billing policy set by your insurance carrier, you may see a separate charge for each anesthesia provider, or one charge combining both components. Your Anesthesiologist leads this anesthesia care team which monitors and manages your vital body functions during your procedure, and is personally responsible for supervision of all anesthesia services. This doctor is also responsible for managing medical problems that might arise related to the procedure, as well as any chronic medical conditions you may have, such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart problems. The CRNA is a specially trained anesthesia provider who works under the direction of the Anesthesiologist to ensure your comfort and safety throughout your procedure. A member of your anesthesia care team will be with you throughout your procedure and recovery. If you have any questions regarding anesthesia billing, please contact Beth Crowley at (800) 242-1131 extension 4355.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Fractures Is It Broken? Posted on December 12, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply A lot of my columns are about how to keep your child out of the Pediatric Emergency Department.  Possible fractures, though, are one time where coming in is the best move. More on this from our two guest columnists, Dr. Nicole Miller and Dr. Sonja Wilson, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette: James woke up Christmas morning and ran downstairs to see what Santa brought.  A note on the Christmas tree said “look outside!”  He opened the back door to find a new trampoline!  James quickly dressed and ran out to enjoy his new toy.  After a few bounces though, he found himself on the ground crying in pain.  His shin was swollen, and it hurt too much to get up and walk.  James and his parents went to the Emergency Department and found that he had fractured his leg.  On Christmas Day! The holidays are here and with this will come new toys and activities.  Kids will be out of school and spending time on bikes, ATVs, trampolines, and scooters.  In the ER at Lafayette General we will be seeing more visits for injured hands, wrists, arms, feet, ankles, and legs.  What is a family to do?  Start by preventing these injuries! Part of preventing fractures is having good bone health.  This starts with a healthy diet. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that kids get 400 International Units (IU) of Vitamin D every day.  One cup of milk is 100 IU.  Vitamin D can be found in a variety of foods and drinks, including soy products and orange juice.  Your skin can make Vitamin D as well, as long as it is exposed to sunlight.  Kids should have at least 15 minutes in the sun every day. How to prevent an injury?  The AAP recommends against having children operate ATVs or other gasoline-powered vehicles, and recommends against having a trampoline.  These are known to have a high risk of causing fractures or even more life-threatening injuries. The key to safe toys is to keep in mind the age, size, and maturity of your child. When buying new toys like bikes and skateboards, don’t skimp on the safety accessories! Also buy helmets for bikes, and helmets and knee/elbow/wrist guards for skateboards. Learning to ride a bike also means learning traffic rules for bike safety. Find a safe place for your child to play.  Avoid busy roads, hills, and streets with multiple parked cars.  Always supervise your kids while playing.  Even with all of this protection, kids get hurt.  Kids play and explore and fall down.  Usually this results in simple bruises and sprains, but sometimes a broken bone results. When should you worry?  Signs of fracture include bruising and swelling over a bone, a snapping sound on impact, difficulty walking or using the injured limb, and obvious crookedness in the limb.  It is harder to tell if young children have a fracture; they can’t tell you about the pain they are experiencing.  If a toddler stops using a hurt limb- bring them in. So what should you do if you think your child has a fracture?  First, limit movements of the hurt limb- apply a splint of rolled up magazines taped around the hurt bone.  DO NOT GIVE YOUR CHILD ANYTHING TO EAT OR DRINK UNTIL YOU SEE A DOCTOR!  If the bone is broken your child may need sedation or anesthesia to fix the bone, and an empty stomach is essential before sedation.  Then bring them in to a place with an x-ray machine. While some practices and urgent care clinics have x-ray, that is not all you need for fracture care.  The facility also needs to be able to put on a splint or cast and have access to an orthopedic surgeon.  For some fractures the bone may need straightening, and then the facility needs to be able to safely sedate the child and/or have an operating suite equipped for children.  Call ahead to the place you plan to go to be sure it has all the services your kid might need.

One night while I was on duty at the hospital, a surprise call came not from the wards, but from my sister!  Her 6 year-old son, Finn, had been playing by the fireplace, tripped, and hit his forehead on the brick mantel.  My sister was panicked: He’s bleeding and does he need stitches!!?? Sometimes it’s difficult for parents to tell if a cut needs stitches, and sometimes a judgment call the parents and doctor make together.  So what lacerations need stitches?  The goals of wound care are to stop bleeding, avoid infection, minimize pain, and minimize scarring.  With these in mind, here’s some guidelines. First, stop bleeding.  Apply pressure to the wound for several minutes with a clean cloth or gauze.  Keep pressure on the whole time; if you keep lifting the cloth to see if the bleeding’s stopped, you won’t give enough time for a clot to form.  Once bleeding has stopped, then clean the wound. Dirty wounds are at greater risk for infection, which worsens pain and scarring. Gently scrub with plain soap and water, and rinse plenty.  If there is lots of imbedded dirt, peroxide can be used to foam out debris.  But just once- too much peroxide poisons tissue and slows healing.  If there’s just too much junk and it hurts too much to clean, that’s a reason to get seen.  We can anesthetize the wound to decrease pain and get the cleaning done.  In kids this is often achieved with an anesthetic ointment we place in the wound and after 45 minutes it’s numb- no shots necessary! Other reasons that kids need to get seen: full thickness lacerations on faces, particularly eyelids, lips, and ears.  These can have worse scars without stitches.  Deep wounds of joints, hands, or feet are at risk for infection and loss of function if not cared for properly.  Crush injuries, or other lacerations that could involve bones need attention too, for the same reasons.  Animal bites also can get infected and transmit rabies. Finn got three stitches (a.k.a sutures) that night, and it was an uneventful experience.  He wasn’t too scared, but many kids freak out when they hear “stitches,” because they think “needles.”  But like we discussed above, the anesthetic gel we put in the wound often numbs the cut completely and injections aren’t needed. Three days later I got another “consult” call from my sister.  She had been instructed to bring Finn back in 3 to 5 days to get the sutures out.  ”Really,” she asked, “is that long enough?”  She also was told to wash the stitches with plain soap and water. Surely there’s more to it than that? Timing of suture removal depends on where the cut is.  Places with great blood supply, like the face and scalp, heal quicker than places with less, like hands and feet.  Blood brings oxygen and nutrients that skin uses to build new tissue.  Blood also brings blood cells that fight infection.  Therefore, cuts on faces and scalps don’t need antibiotics because the blood keeps things clean.  But cuts on hand and feet should get antibiotics because of less blood supply, and hands and feet tend to be dirtier than faces and scalps. Also, animal bites always get antibiotics, no matter where the bite is, to prevent infection. Face sutures can be removed after 3-5 days, scalps 7 days, arms and legs 10 days, and hands and feet 14 days.  If we leave the sutures in longer than that, the suture material can irritate and make worse scars.  We’ve all seen scars with the row of white dots lining the sides of the scar- don’t want that on a face! It’s also important to wash the cut once daily, and yes, plain soap and water is enough. But a brief wash: no long tub soaks or swimming with stitches.  After washing, apply antibiotic ointment and a bandage.  If the skin gets red and itchy from the bandaid, you can use paper tape.  Or if it’s only a few days before suture removal, leave the bandage off. Kids like Finn play and get cuts, and sometimes need stitches.  But you needn’t freak out about pain and having to care for sutures.  It’s as easy as the adage, “A stitch in time…” Posted in Stitches | Leave a reply Hey…Stitch This! Posted on January 13, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Frank Betanski, a Family Practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. “OUCH!!” (ou-ch); exclamation ; a four-letter word indicating urgency and anxiety when children get a cut.  It raises questions with parents that are often confusing and overwhelming: “Does this need stitches?”  ”Should I go to the ER?”  ”Oh Lord, what is THAT??!!”  My mother faced these questions when I returned home from the movie “Edward Scissorhands.”  I grabbed the cutlery and literally started running with scissors.  So let’s discuss the how-to’s (and don’ts) of skin injuries. First, some terminology: -Laceration: tear into the skin with blunt force. -Avulsion: A chunk of skin is removed, exposing a hole in the tissue. -Puncture: stab through the skin -Incision: laceration made with a sharp-edged object (knife, glass, scalpel, etc) You’re thinking: “Thanks for the vocab lesson, doc, but what to do right now with all this bleeding?” FIrst, apply pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.  Pressing for several minutes will stop most bleeding.  Remember, constantly lifting pressure to check if the bleeding has stopped will just prolong the bleeding.  Be patient, hold that wound for a good five minutes before checking.  If the cloth becomes soaked with blood, put a new cloth on top of the old one.  Should the bleeding not stop, head to the ER. Once bleeding has stopped, wash your hands and remove dirt by running water over the wound.  Don¨t scrub the wound yet.  The old faithful hydrogen peroxide can help clean. Peroxide kills germs and can “bubble up” dirt and dead skin.  Only use peroxide once. Multiple uses can poison good tissue and delay healing.  Soaking open wounds in a mix of water and betadine also kills germs. If there is no more bleeding for áwhile, then you can gently scrub the wound with a washcloth if ít has embedded debris. We see a variety of lacerations in the Emergency Department, and a variety of parental questions about management.  Sometimes the child has a tiny scrape the size of an eyelash, with Dad asking if we should call plastic surgery.  At the other extreme, the kid comes in with a mangled hand that looks like it was attacked by a bulldozer, with Mom wondering if it needs a bandaid. So when should you bring your child in?  Here are some examples: heavy bleeding that doesn´t stop after 5 to 10 minutes of direct pressure.  Deep (down to fat or muscle layers) and/or longer than one inch.  Large, gaping cuts on the face.  Animal or human bites that break the skin.  Dirty wounds that you can’t get all the debris out. Signs of infection like increased pain, spreading redness, swelling, or drainage. Many wounds heal themselves without stitches, and sometimes doctors prefer to leave wounds open to heal “from the bottom up.”  For example, we don´t stitch most animal bites, so that the stitches don’t trap infection inside the wound.  We stitch cuts mainly to minimize scarring and improve how the scar will look. Stitching wounds also can stop bleeding, increase scar strength, heal cuts faster, and decrease pain.  Face and forehead wounds can particularly need stitches for the best cosmetic result.  On the other hand, cuts inside the mouth and on the tongue, even deep ones, rarely need stitches. The inside of the mouth heals miraculously, closing big wounds in a few days. We have many methods to close wounds: stitches (a.k.a. sutures), medical glue, staples, steri-strips (sterile tape).  Glue is good for clean, no-tension incisions.  If the wound cannot be easily closed by gently pushing the edges together, or has shaggy edges, then stitches are better.  Staples are best for areas where scarring is not an issue (inside hair lines). By the way, don’t remove medical staples yourself with an office staple remover.  Paper and medical staples are different animals.  Been there, saw that, saw the scar…. When in doubt, call your doctor, or maybe even send a picture from your phone.  Doctors can often tell you over the phone if a wound needs stitches, but sometimes we just gotta see it for ourselves, to know if we need to…Stitch This! Posted in Stitches | Leave a reply Needing Stitches? Posted on July 21, 2009 by klfydoctor 1 In most of my blog entries, I discuss how to stay out of the Emergency Department.  However, getting a deep cut that needs stitches is one of those times that it is probably best to bring your kid to the ED.  Here are some good things to know. What cuts need stitches?  These are cuts that are through the skin where you can see fat inside, cuts that are gaping open, cuts that will leave as wide a scar as the cut itself.  One old wives tale is that if you wait too long, the cut can not be stitched.  This is not true- if you are out fishing, get a cut, and can’t get in before four hours, you can still get stitches and minimize infection and scarring. Do I need a plastic surgeon?  Many parents wonder about this since so many of kid’s cuts are on their faces.  Kids meet the world with their big and heavy heads, and parents worry that cuts on foreheads, eyebrows, lips, and chins will leave noticeable scars.  It is an old wives tale again that plastic surgeons do some magic with these cuts that ED doctors don’t.  For the vast majority of those cuts, the plastic surgeon would do nothing different than the ED doc- sew it up!  All cuts leave some scar, but most kid scars on faces fade after six months to a year and are barely noticeable.  If the scar ends up looking bad, then it is time to see the plastic surgeon for a “scar revision.”  But again, the plastic surgeon would do nothing different for the first closure. Will it hurt?  If your ED is really with the times, they will numb the cut with an anesthetic gel- no shots needed!  It takes about three applications over 30-40 minutes.  The gel works great for faces, scalps,  and most limb cuts.  It can not be used for fingers and toes.  Then the cleaning and stitching are painless.   However, fidgety babies and toddlers will still need to hold still for their stitches and may need to be on the velcro “papoose” board.  Then there will often be plenty of screaming because no toddler likes to be trapped.  At least they won’t feel the stitches themselves!  Also, there are no reports of toddlers needing psychotherapy later in life because they were traumatized by the papoose experience. How do I take care of the stitches?  After stitches are put in, keeping them clean and covered is important to lessen scarring.  Yet another old wives tale (that many doctors believe!) is that stitches should be left out in the open.  In fact, stitches heal faster and with smaller scars if they are cleaned gently once per day with plain soap and water, then covered with over-the-counter antibiotic ointment and a bandage.  No swimming, no long soaks, no peroxide.  Peroxide is best for a one-time, first cleaning of a cut, but after that too much peroxide poisons tissue and slows down healing. Finally, few cuts with stitches need antibiotics.  If they are cleaned well and on a body place with good blood circulation (faces, scalps), infections are very rare.  The cuts that need antibiotics are those from animal bites, or dirty wounds on limbs. If you have any questions about the stitching experience, or have a stitching story to share, please comment!

Keep them in school! Posted on January 23, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply It is no secret that doctor’s offices and Emergency Departments are extremely busy these days.  It is the “cold and flu” season, and RSV season, and that makes for a lot of sick kids.  In other columns and blog entries, I have discussed which kids do not need to be brought to the Emergency Department, when they don’t have an urgent condition.  It is even more disappointing when a parent brings a kid in who is not terribly sick, but needs a form filled out to return to school or daycare.  The parent is not happy either- they often know their child is okay, but are missing work and pay, and can’t get into their doctor that day to get the child back into class. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published guidelines about when kids can be kept in school and daycare.  Rashes without fever, coughs and colds, and “pink eye” can be kept in school.  However, a recent study in the AAP journal Pediatrics surveyed day care directors about knowledge of these guidelines.  The study showed that the vast majority of directors would keep out kids who could have stayed.  Teachers in public schools do not fare much better.  I have seen too many kids in the Emergency Department with notes required for things like rashes and pink eye. Here is a basic list of the conditions that DO NOT have to be kept out of school or daycare: -Rashes, including scabies, ringworm, and poison ivy (NOT CONTAGIOUS!) -Coughs and colds -Fevers that have gone in 24 hours and the child is acting well - Conjunctivitis, or “pink eye” -Non bloody diarrhea that the child can control, or that is contained in the diaper What should be kept out of school?  Any condition with fever and the child acting sick, and vomiting.  In the study in Pediatrics, vomiting was about the only guideline that daycare directors got right. To be fair, the American Academy of Pediatrics has not done a great job of making these guidelines accessible to schools, day cares, daycare licensing agencies, and the public.  They can only be found in two expensive books, one of which is a textbook for pediatricians.  If you go to the AAP website, you can’t find these guidelines.  A general internet search will bring up one AAP school guideline which is not very clear, and a lot of individual county and government guidelines which often conflict with the AAP guidelines. In Lafayette, day cares are bound by licensing requirements that also might keep more kids out than necessary. Therefore, school and daycare guidelines are often written with no expert input.  Then teachers must follow these guidelines, because that is all they have to go on. So, teachers, daycares, governments, and schools!  Please revisit your policies on what kids to keep out of school, and when to take them back.  At least keep the note requirements to a minimum!  Doctor’s offices and Emergency Departments could use a break.  Working parents could use a break.  The kids DON’T need a break- keep them where they can continue to play and learn.

CIS typically contracts with hospital organizations to provide access to their cardiologists. Lafayette General Health is able to leverage this relationship to improve cardiovascular care at Lafayette General Medical and at satellite locations when they refer patients to CIS at Lafayette General. Since 2011, Lafayette General and Cardiovascular Institute of the South have pioneered a partnership to create a hospital-physician co-management agreement. The purpose of the agreement was to allow CIS cardiologists to be the decision makers in developing and achieving the high standards of care Lafayette General strives to achieve. Remaining authority for clinical, budgetary, technology and quality decision-making remains with the Lafayette General administration. This mutually beneficial partnership has had tremendous results. It has fostered drastically better patient outcomes, stronger quality measures, shorter lengths of stay, reduced readmissions and higher patient satisfaction surveys for cardiology patients. With the resources of Lafayette General Health, CIS cardiologists have the ability to advance the frontiers of innovation and research, utilize superior technology and acquire top specialists covering all facets of heart and vascular medicine. In 2013, Lafayette General Health extended access of its CIS cardiologists beyond Lafayette General Medical Center to include University Hospital & Clinics, where quality cardiology services were in high demand. The co-management model of CIS at Lafayette General creates a culture of excellence that permeates the entire support staff of each organization, and Lafayette General has molded other co-management agreements in other service lines across its system based on this exemplary model of success. $(document).ready(function () {

Posted on July 10, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply The rock band Pink Floyd was known in its day for being loud.  Legend was that at a concert in 1971, the noise was so bad that it killed the fish in a pond next to the stage. Probably more truthfully, the fish went belly up due to fans dancing in the pond, smoke bombs, and the giant inflatable octopus on the water (Pink Floyd was also known for eccentric decorations).  But fish dying because of loudness is a better story. Many rock stars have hearing loss due to the chronic and loud sound of their profession. Phil Collins, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, and Pete Townsend of the Who are just some of the victims of their own success.  The listening apparatus inside our ears is delicate, and can be injured or permanently damaged. We’ve all come home from rock concerts to lie down and hear ringing in our ears. That ringing is the sound of acoustic injury.  Usually the ringing goes away, the hearing organ heals up.  Sometimes the ringing doesn’t go away. William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk on Star Trek, has permanent ringing in his ears. This condition, called Tinnitis, started when a special effects explosion went off too close to his head.  Since then he has been tormented by what he calls a “hiss-static,” night and day. Many military veterans also have Tinnitis from rifles, grenades, naval guns, and rocket launches.  Besides pounding targets, these explosions also pound the ear drum, the delicate bones behind the drum that transmit sound, and the fragile nerves that receive the bones’ signals. Kids are vulnerable to hearing loss too.  Remember when the Saints won the Super Bowl? Remember Drew Brees holding his infant son, Baylen, and Baylen’s earphones?  Baylen had them to protect his hearing from the roar of the crowd.  Your kids need to be wearing those too, when they are hunting, mowing lawns, or going to rock concerts.  Well, no kid who wants to be cool is wearing those to a show, but consider other protection: fewer concerts, more subtle ear plugs, quieter venues. I married into a loud family, and they laughingly admit it.  Thanksgiving can be deafening , with 50-plus Fournets packed into a house.  It’s like the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, except with pork roast instead of lamb, and conversation sprinkled with french instead of greek. Part of the noise is due to hearing loss in my in-laws.  They have to shout to be heard.  My father-in-law ran a service station, flew airplanes, and hunted.  His sons worked in the station and also hunted.  And the sons went to plenty of rock concerts. All those roaring engines, shotguns, and guitars while growing up took a toll. When considering hearing injury, we think of the really loud noises mentioned above- guns, explosions, amplifiers.  But sustained moderate noise can cause hearing loss too. Just like too much running can lead to overuse injuries in knees and feet, chronic intense sounds can also hurt ears.  Mowers, blenders, hair dryers, TV, car radios, and ipods all contribute to hearing loss.  Even cell phones glued to your kids’ ears can be too much. Some people are more susceptible to hearing loss than others.  The Fournets have a family history of hearing loss, and the youngest son had some warning to start wearing headphones while hunting, woodworking, and mowing the lawn. Are you worried about your child losing his hearing?  Parents usually worry about hearing loss when their kid seems not to hear them: they shout and shout and get no answer. Fortunately this deafness is usually due to them tuning you out rather than true hearing loss.  Kids get lots of hearing screening at school.  Lafayette Parish schools screen in kindergarten, first grade, and every other year after that to eleventh grade.  But if you are worried, your doctor can recommend testing at audiology and ENT offices. Better still, worry about your kids hearing ahead of time and take action.  Keep the phones, car radios, and MP3 players dialed down.  Turn down (heck, turn off) the TV. Set limits on the number and intensity of concerts, and get them headphones for chronic noise makers.  Then maybe they’ll hear you when you call them to do the dishes.  Or not.

Whether it's greeting someone in the front lobby, working in the gift shop, performing clerical duties, or being there for a patient, the volunteer programs are varied to meet the system's needs and your talents and schedule. What Volunteer Duties Are Available? Assist patients in various areas Help in a doctor’s office Staff information desks Work in the gift shop Pastoral Care Visitor transport Human Resources and so much more! LGMC Auxiliary The Auxiliary was established in 1962 to assist Lafayette General Medical Center in providing services and goodwill to the community. Our Auxiliary members can be found at information desks in the front lobby and throughout the hospital. They also assist with special projects and activities throughout the year. Pastoral Care Any person associated with a church or parish of any denomination may become a volunteer in the Pastoral Care program, though certain prerequisites must be met, such as a written recommendation from your minister or pastor. Pastoral Care volunteers have an important role in visiting new patients in hospitals and assessing what ministry is needed. Friends in Deed The Friends in Deed program offers volunteer positions for those whose interests lie in other areas – from assisting families in our waiting areas to clerical duties. Benefits of Volunteering Our volunteers are selfless individuals, secure in the knowledge that their efforts are creating a healthy and peaceful environment for patients and families to recuperate.

Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog! Posted in Spanking , Talking to Babies and Toddlers , Time-outs | Leave a reply ADHD Or Just Bad Behavior? Posted on January 15, 2016 by klfydoctor 3 This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Seth Koster, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Is your child ”bouncing off the walls” or “just won’t listen?”  Pediatricians and family physicians see lots of kids with behavior problems.  Parents or teachers often want to know if this is ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or just bad behavior? ADHD is a hot topic.  Some claim that ADHD is only bad behavior from ineffective parenting- “she just needs a good spanking!”‘  On the other extreme, some kids receive ADHD medication who don’t need it. Regardless if you believe ADHD is real, here are tips on helping kids act better.  Kids who don’t have ADHD respond to these tips; kids who do may respond less consistently, but will still be happier and better behaved. Spanking? Many ask, to spank or not to spank?  A bigger question is why are you spanking?  If you do spank your child, avoid doing this in anger.  Only spank for behavior that’s dangerous, like running into the street, not for something small. Explain why you’re punishing. He may not understand right away, but kids get more than you think and will eventually catch on. More importantly, reward good behavior.  Positive reinforcement is MUCH more effective than punishment.  Saying things like “Thank you for being so quiet,” and “You did a good job picking up your room” is great behavior modification. Every kid (and adult!) likes praise, and kids will work to earn more. Don’t be sarcastic, or make fun of your child. Young children are sensitive, and cutting remarks and mean-spirited teasing hurt feelings.  Pre-teens and teens don’t like that either.  If you are unpleasant to your children, they will grow up thinking that it’s okay to be abused and to abuse others Build family traditions. Many households lack structure or traditions.  Do something together!  Go to a park or to church every Sunday, or have Friday night pizza as a family. Kids look forward to these things- it’s something to do with mom and dad. Also keep extended family in mind and make time for them. Keep a home routine, or “rhythm.”  Chaotic homes make chaotic children.  Some kids who seem to have ADHD just aren’t used to having to sit still and follow along; they never learned how at home.  We know it’s especially important to have a routine home life for children with autism or ADHD, but every kid behaves better and is happier with structure. Keep the same bedtimes.  Don’t let kids stay up later with phones or watching TV-that’s cheating!  Eat meals together at regular times. Give your children daily and weekly chores. Even kids as young as 5 years-old want to help, and should start picking up after themselves.  Be realistic though; the seven year old shouldn’t be shingling the roof.  5-6 year-olds can clean rooms, 8-9 year-olds can help with dishes and take out trash, and 13 year-olds can mow lawns and babysit younger siblings for short periods. Expect your children to RESPECT others. Respecting adults and peers is important. The Golden Rule, “Treat people as you want to be treated,” even very young children understand.  This is the South- we expect ”yes sir” and “no ma’am.”  Doing this will help your kids earn respect in turn. Set a good example by respecting others in speech and action.  Your child should never hear you curse.  If (or when?) you do mess up, be honest with your children and tell them you expect better from yourself, and them. Don’t argue with your kids, or ask them “why” they did something. If they misbehave, punish them appropriately and briefly explanation why they acted badly.  Asking them why makes it personal, as if they are bad inside and not just simply making a mistake.  If they argue with your reasoning, don’t engage them in the argument.  As Dr. Hamilton used to say to his kids, “This isn’t an argument, this is simply how you should act.” The most challenging child can benefit from these tips. Try them out; if you don’t make progress with difficult behavior, you’re not alone!  Talk with your doctor or school counselor.  They can help you with behavior techniques, to help your kids be the best they can be. Posted in Bad Behavior , Spanking | 3 Replies Spare The Rod, Improve The Child Posted on November 27, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply I see it almost every day in the Pediatric Emergency Department: a little one running about the unit yelling, throwing toys, crawling under the curtains.  The parent says something like “Come back here or you’ll get a whipping when we get home,” which the child ignores. The parent repeats the threat, this time in a ominous, growly voice, which again has no effect. Other parents or the nurses say “That kid doesn’t have ADHD, she just needs a good spanking!” Spanking is a time honored tradition in America.  While other developed cultures have given it up as ineffective, many parents in the US still whack away on their kids, not knowing that there are much better ways to modify a child’s behavior.  Pediatricians have known for years that children who are spanked are more aggressive towards others. When parents spank a child for bad behavior, the child gets the message that hitting is okay.  A doctor friend of mine tells of once slapping his 2 year-old boy’s hand when he misbehaved.  The child became thoughtful, the wheels turning in his head.  He then slapped his own hand, then slapped his father’s hand, trying out this new behavior Dad had showed, and Dad realized he had made a mistake. A new study on spanking came out in October’s issue of the journal Pediatrics.  It showed that children who are spanked may develop language and problem-solving skills slower than children who are disciplined other ways.  When children are spanked to stop their bad behavior, they don’t learn self-control for themselves.  The self control is demanded from the outside, by the angry parent.  And if the child doesn’t learn self control, he can’t stay controlled enough to solve conflicts with others.  The child resorts to aggression he learned from the parent.  He also can’t stay controlled enough to absorb language that he hears around him. Now, am I saying that parents should just ignore bad behavior?  No way!  A child absolutely needs to learn how not to be annoying, disruptive, or destructive.  She must learn how to get along with others in a non-violent way.  What pediatricians are saying is that there are much more effective ways to teach good behavior than spanking. The first important thing about stopping bad behavior is to stop it immediately. Threats of future discipline, second chances, putting off punishment for later, are just ways of letting the child “off the hook.”  Little kids don’t think about the future- if you don’t discipline them right away, in their minds they get away with it.  You may say “don’t do that,” but your inaction tells the child that bad behavior is really okay.  Our disruptive child from above learns nothing when the parent says “you’ll get a spanking when we get home.”  He cannot imagine of a later time when punishment might happen because of his misbehavior now.  He just can’t put that two-and-two together in his little brain yet! A much more effective discipline is the time-out.  But there are rules that make time-out work best.  The first rule is that the child has no interaction during the time-out.  This means putting the child in a chair facing a corner where there is nothing fun to look at.  This also means that no one, even the parent, should talk to the child.  Having a conversation with the child during time-out, even if it is about the child’s bad behavior, is still a reward for the child, not a punishment.  The child is getting the parent’s attention, which is often the point of the bad behavior anyway. Time-out should last one minute for each year of the child’s age: two-year-olds get two minutes of time-out, four year-olds four minutes, and so on.  If a child won’t stay in a time-out chair, they then need to buckled in!  One of my daughters needed buckling in, and when that upset her she would kick the wall to topple over the chair!  We would have to quietly pull the chair back far enough so she couldn’t reach the wall.  After the time-out, if the child agrees that they can behave better, they are free.  If they can’t agree (sometimes my daughter wouldn’t) or go back to the same bad behavior, back into time-out and the clock starts afresh.  This way the child learns self-control to earn their freedom. So consider time-out instead of spanking for your kid.  Spare the rod, but don’t spoil the child.  Time-out is more work for a parent, but isn’t your child worth it?

Juice in one hand, 2 year-old in the other, 15 minutes late for work.  I buckle my girl into her car seat, off to daycare.  After the second curve, screaming came from the back.  In the rear view mirror I saw only feet, sticking up in the air! I pulled over and found my daughter and her seat upside down, a confused look on her face.  What happened?  Someone had borrowed the car seat and forgot to re-buckle it when putting it back in my car. Summer travel season is approaching, so everyone needs a reminder on car seat safety: road injuries are the leading cause of preventable deaths in children in the United States.  “Preventable” is an important word in that statistic, because 71% of those deaths would be avoided with proper child seat use. And “proper” seat use is another important caveat, since 4 out of 5 car seats are used incorrectly, with an average of three mistakes for every seat! Car seats are complicated things to buckle and position; ask anyone who has tried.  But it’s your kid’s best safety device, since car crashes are her most likely way to die.  Some important tips: -Know your car seat!  Read the manual! -Rear-facing seats: for newborns until age 2, or until the child reaches maximum height and weight for that seat (read that manual!).  Most bad crashes are head-on, and rear-facing supports baby’s heavy head. -Forward-facing seats: when your child has outgrown the rear-facing seat.  Some seats are convertible, from rear to forward-facing.  Your child should stay in this seat until he maxes the seat’s height and weight (manual!) -Booster seat: used with the car’s standard lap and shoulder harness, to position the child so that the adult seatbelts give maximum protection.  A child sitting in a regular seat would have the shoulder harness resting on his neck (very bad!), and the lap belt over his belly instead of his hip bones.  Boosters avoid this, and are for kids age 4 to 7 years. Once we saw a case where a car had been hit by a truck.  The driver cried to the firefighters that her baby was in back, but they couldn’t see baby because the car was so crumpled.  They heard no noise from inside and feared the worst.  It took 45 minutes to cut away the roof and find baby in her car seat, sleeping quietly, clutching her stuffed rabbit.  When we examined baby in the ER, she was completely unscathed.  Hooray for car seats! The backseat is actually the safest place in car crashes, and kids of all ages should be back there, not in front.  It’s not convenient, but it’s safer, and it’s the law.  Follow the rules every time, even for short drives.  Inconsistency with restraint use confuses children, again is illegal, and we see many injuries with unbelted kids when ”I was just going down the block!”  All kids under 13 should be in the back seat; airbags in front can kill younger children. Shoulder and seat belt use: when kids are 80 lbs. and 4 feet 9 inchest tall, they can go in booster seats, at about 8-12 years old.  When using regular seat belts, the lap belt should fit snugly across the thighs, not on the groin or belly.  The shoulder belt should lie on the mid-shoulder, at least two inches from the neck. Correct installation: to tell if you have strapped the car seat in properly, use the “tug test,” tugging the seat from side to side.  It shouldn’t move more than an inch.  The “pinch test” ensures that the seat’s shoulder straps are snug on the child; you shouldn’t be able to pinch a fold in those straps when she’s buckled.  Young infants should have their seats in a semi-reclining position; if baby is too upright, his heavy head could fall forward and pinch off his airway.  Most seats have a built-in level on the side to show the proper recline. If you get a used car seat, be absolutely sure it hasn’t been in a crash.  Replace ones that have been in a crash, are broken, or expired.  Throw them away, don’t give them away! Finally, always wear YOUR seat belt.  Be a good example, and stay alive for your children! Posted in Car Safety | Leave a reply Car Seats: Whining Down the Road Posted on August 20, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s Guest Columnist is Dr. John Giuffreda, a family practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. It happens too often: mom takes baby out of the car seat because she is fussy, dad takes his eyes off the road to look at what is going on with baby, and SMACK!  At the time of a car crash impact, physics dictates that baby suddenly weighs a ton and flies out of mom’s arms, no matter how tight she holds.  Where baby hits inside the car, we hate to think. Being in a car crash is a traumatic event for anyone, including children.  Using a child car seat is the best protection you can give your kid.  Every state requires that an infant or small child be in a seat.  And with good reason- accidental injury is the leading cause of death in children, and most such injuries are automobile crashes. Child safety seats are fantastic inventions.  They substantially reduce the risk of a fatal injury.  Yet many safety seats are used incorrectly.  When choosing any car seat, following some guidelines will help ensure a child’s safety.  The best car seat is not always the most expensive one- it’s the one that best fits a child’s weight, size, and age, as well as your car. Once you select a seat be sure to try it out, keeping in mind that store displays and illustrations might not show the correct usage.  It’s up to you to learn how to install a car seat properly and harness your child for the ride.  Here are some guidelines: -Choose a seat with a label saying it meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213. -Read the instructions! -Accept a used seat with caution.  Never use a seat more than 6 years old or that was in a crash.  Avoid seats that are missing parts, are cracked, or don’t have an instruction manual.  If you have any doubt about a seat’s history, don’t use it! -If you get a used seat, call the manufacturer for recommendations on how much useful life the seat has left, and information on recalls.  Recalls are common and the manufacturer may be able to send you replacement parts or a new model. -For new or used seats, fill out the product registration card so you will be notified about recalls. When my daughter was half way through grade school, she decided that her booster seat was for babies.  She had long legs and the booster only went half way down her thighs, making the seat uncomfortable for long rides too.  She was also pretty skinny and for a long time did not meet the weight requirement to sit in an adult seat belt.  It was whine whine whine all the way. These days car seats and booster seats are much more comfortable, but there are different seats and seat positions for different ages. Birth to 12 months: Kids under 12 months should always ride in a seat that faces the rear of the car.  There are different types of rear-facing seats.  There are infant-only seats, or convertible 3-in-1 seats.  The convertible seats have higher height and weight limits, allowing you to keep your child rear-facing as he grows. 1 to 3 years: Keep your child rear-facing for as long as possible.  Its the best position for high-impact crashes.  Kids should remain rear-facing until they reach the top height or weight limit allowed by the manufacturer.  Once the child outgrows the rear-facing seat, he is ready to travel in a forward-facing seat with a harness. 4-7 years: Again, keep your child in the car seat with harness until reaching the top weight and height limits for that seat.  Then it is time to travel in a booster seat. 8-12 years: Keep your child in a booster until he or she is big enough to fit in a regular seat belt.  For boosters and seat belts, the lap belt must lie snugly across the upper thighs, not across the belly.  Shoulder belts should lie on the shoulder and chest, not across the neck.  Remember: your child should ALWAYS ride in the back seat because it’s safer there. So use those car seats properly, in the back seat.  Sometimes you’ll just have to take it as they whine on down the road. Posted in Car Safety | Leave a reply Slow Down, Kids Around Posted on May 25, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply We were already busy that night-  every bed had a sick or injured child in it.   The waiting room was also full, full of families clamoring to be seen too.  Then, when it always seems the time is wrong, the ambulance phone rang.  They were bringing in a six year-old child who was hit by a car.  His head and belly were bruised up and his left leg was broken. When they arrived, our patient was semi-conscious and his left shin was crooked just below the knee, the bone broken.  His  brain and lungs were bruised on the CT scan.   His leg needed surgery, so off to the operating room he went. The part that had us really loving the boy was when he woke up just before surgery he told us, ”I’m okay, just gimme some crutches and I can walk home.”  Why is it that often the most sick and hurt are the least trouble, and the family with the kid with the runny nose are the biggest complainers about waiting times and not getting antibiotics?   After surgery, our favorite patient went to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Our PICU doctors at Lafayette General are teaming up with the Lafayette Parish Health Department to start a new campaign to prevent the kind of injury like our wonderful boy.  It is called Slow Down, Kids Around. Slow Down, Kids Around is our own take on a very successful program from Indianapolis called Drive Smart, Kids Dart.  Both programs were actually started by our PICU specialist, Dr. Rey DelaRosa.  It involves giving away signs to post in your yard reminding motorists to, you guessed it, SLOW DOWN. The first event will be this June 5, Saturday, from 10 am to 1 pm at the Academy sports store on Ambassador Caffery.  Show up to get your own yard sign for your neighborhood!  And again, Slow Down, Kids Around.

Posted on March 7, 2013 by klfydoctor 1 When I was in college, I volunteered at a homeless shelter.  Back then people were allowed to smoke indoors, and after a night shift I would leave with my hair stiff with cigarette smoke.  Then I caught a cold, and a cough that did not go away.  I hacked all day and woke up through the night coughing.  After a month of misery, I went to the infirmary.  The Physician Assistant there said I had a cold and gave me some cough drops. Weeks later, still hacking, I went back.  The PA did the same things, to no effect.  Weeks after that I went back yet again, insisting on seeing the doctor.  The doctor listened carefully to my story, said I had mild asthma from the combination of the cold and the cigarette smoke, and gave me an inhaler.  Within days my cough was gone. Many people find asthma confusing and complex.  It is sometimes hard to diagnose, like my episode above.  It can be triggered by many things and the medicines can be confusing- what do I give my kids when they are sick?  How do we use an inhaler?  What medicines should they take when they are well?  How do I avoid asthma attacks? Asthma, simply put, is wheezing that can be reversed by medicines.  In asthma, the airways in your lungs are extra sensitive to irritants.  The airways close up to keep out those irritants: cold viruses, pollen, cigarette smoke, extra cold air.  When the airways narrow and close, the wheezing you hear and feel is your breath whistling through those skinnier passages. To reverse airway narrowing, we use two classes of medicines.  The first are called bronchodilators, that open up (“dilate”) your airways (“bronchioles”).  These medicines are breathed in through inhalers and nebulizers.  the second medicines are steroids, like prednisone, which take away the swelling in inflamed airways.  Prednisone is a different steroid from the steroids athletes abuse.  For the four-to-seven day courses we use for asthma, prednisone does not cause weight gain, hair growth, or rage attacks.  For people with really bad asthma, there are medicines to take daily to make the airways less sensitive and help prevent attacks.  These are called “controller” medicines. More important than treating asthma is avoiding asthma and its attacks.  Asthma is increasing in the population in the past 25 years, and many of the things that cause asthma are all around us.  Pollutants like smoke, soot, and diesel exhaust eat at our lung tissue as we breathe.  We live more and more indoors these days, and therefore have more exposure to indoor lung irritants like dust and mold.  The more time we spend indoors too, the more time we are exposed to our fellow humans and the cough and congestion viruses they give us. All those irritants assaulting the lining of our air passages add up.  Some people have lungs that can take the abuse.  Those with more sensitive lungs, like kids, get asthma.  As we talked about above, when the air passages have had enough, they close up to keep out the bad stuff.  Unfortunately, when they close up, they also keep out the air we need to live.  What little air we can move in and out whistles through those narrowed air passages and we wheeze, and we have to pull and tug to get the air in and out. So how do we and our kids avoid all those irritants?  First, let’s not be so hard on the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA).  The EPA is not there to shut down factories, it is there to help those factories do less damage to our lungs from air pollution.  Second, we need to avoid cigarette smoke.  Smokers should never smoke indoors, at home with children, or at work or at bars with adults.  Heck, smokers should see a doctor for help to quit!  Finally, we and our kids need to spend more time outdoors, away from indoor dust and mold and sick people.  Exercise is good for the lungs (and the rest of the body too) so outdoor activities are a double win. So if you or your kids have a cough that won’t go away, or wheeze, see your doctor.  You should talk about how to avoid asthma irritants, medicines to take for attacks, and if need be, medicines to prevent attacks.  You and your kids should be allowed to breathe easy. Posted in Asthma Care | 1 Reply Asthma- smoke, allergens, inhalers, steroids- help! Posted on September 14, 2011 by klfydoctor 1 When I was in college, I volunteered at the local homeless shelter.  Back then you were allowed to smoke indoors, and the morning after a night shift I would leave with my hair stiff with the smell of cigarettes (I had a lot more hair back then).  The next time I caught a cold, I was left with a cough that did not go away.  I hacked all day and woke up through the night coughing.  After a month of misery, I went to the college infirmary.  The PA there said I had a cold, and sent me on my way with a paper packet of cheap and gritty cough drops. Weeks later, still hacking,  I went back.  The PA said and did the same things, again to no effect.  Weeks after that I went back yet again, this time insisting on seeing the doctor.  The doctor listened carefully to my story, said I had mild asthma from the combination of the cold and the cigarette smoke, and gave me an inhaler.  Within days, my cough was gone. Many people find asthma confusing and complex.  It is sometimes hard to diagnose, like my episode above.  It can be triggered by so many things and all the medicines can be confusing- what do I take when I am sick, and what medicines do I take when I am well?  Hopefully the next few paragraphs will give you a better understanding. Asthma, simply put, is wheezing that can be reversed by medicines.  In asthma, airways in your lungs are extra-sensitive to irritants, and close up to keep out those irritants- cold viruses,  pollen and other allergens, and cigarette smoke.  When the airways narrow and close, the wheezing you hear and feel is your breath whistling through those skinnier passages. To reverse that airway narrowing, we use two classes of medicines.  The first are called bronchodilators, that open up (“dilate”) your airways (“bronchioles”).  These medicines are breathed in through inhalers and nebulizers.  The second medicines are steroids, which take away the swelling in inflamed airways.  Prednisone, taken as pills or syrup, is the most commonly used steroid.  Prednisone is very different from the steroid athletes abuse.  For the short five-to-seven day courses we use for asthma, it does not cause weight gain, hair growth, or rage attacks. The most important treatment for asthma is to avoid the things that irritate.  If dogs make your kid wheeze, don’t get a dog!  Teach your asthmatic kids good hand-washing so they don’t get so many cold viruses at school.  If you smoke and your kid has asthma, quit!  At the very least, smoke outside the house and car where your kids breath. Finally, for bad cases of asthma, there are medicines to take when you are well, all the time .  There are pills and inhaled steroids (again, perfectly safe)  that keep your airways from being so sensitive.  If exercise makes your kid wheeze, there are inhalers to take before exercise to help that.  All asthmatic kids should get a flu shot in the fall, since the influenza virus is particularly hard on airways. If all this is still confusing, ask your doctor for a written asthma plan to help you keep it straight.  Your child with asthma should be able to go to school, to run and play, without having asthma attacks.  If he can’t, see your doctor to improve the asthma plan.  And for heaven’s sake, if you smoke, see your doctor about ways to quit!

Thanks to a quality initiative through Ochsner Health Network, Lafayette General, its providers and members of Acadian Healthcare Alliance were able to join the program. LGMD participation includes Michael Alexander, M.D., Tyler Perrin Bellelo, M.D., Scott Bergeaux, M.D., Deanna Blanchard, M.D., Bradley Chastant II, M.D., Debra Durham, M.D., Milton Jolivette, Jr., M.D., Dale Leleux, M.D., Elizabeth McLain, M.D., Fallon McManus, M.D., Kathryn Martin, NP, Joseph Orgeron, M.D., Juan Perez-Ruiz, M.D., Cassandra Pillette, M.D., Creighton Shute, D.O., Leslie Sizemore, M.D., Angela Snow, M.D., Michelle Taylor, M.D., and Thomas Voitier II, M.D. QBPC is a population health and quality improvement program designed to get better outcomes for patients, particularly those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, vascular disease, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Blue Cross developed QBPC to better support physicians in the network and work more closely with them. The program takes a team approach to health care, and gives providers the tools and resources they need to focus on improving care quality for all of their patients, not just those who are actively seeking treatment. Dr. Paul Murphree, Interim Chief Medical Officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, welcomed LGMD Physician Group as the latest QBPC provider. “We believe QBPC is the right direction for healthcare, so we can work together to boost patients’ health outcomes and reduce costs, which will result in greater value for all,” Murphree said.

Posted on February 5, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply I can still see my oldest daughter, 10 years-old then, with her forehead on the dinner table.  She could not eat, her stomach hurt too bad.  At that time she was having some school trouble, so my wife and I passed it off as anxiety or a virus, and excused her to go lie on the couch.  Later that night when I got home from violin lessons, my wife and daughter were curled up together on my daughter’s bed.  Now the pain was on her right lower side, and was getting worse.  I had a feel of her abdomen, and we went to my Emergency Department.  There were blood and urine tests and an IV, a visit from the surgeon, and the next morning my daughter had her appendix taken out. Abdominal pain is a common reason for visits to the Emergency Department.  Often parents are worried that the pain means something bad, like appendicitis, that needs surgery.  When the pain is accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea, parents worry that the child might get dehydrated.  The diarrhea and vomiting is messy too, and they want it to stop.  Parents also come because the pain just plain hurts, and they don’t want to see their child suffer. So when is stomach ache not an emergency?  First, when it starts with diarrhea and vomiting, that is usually a “stomach virus,” an infection the child caught from someone else.  The vomiting usually only lasts half a day, the diarrhea for 3 to 4 days, and it is unusual for a child to get so dehydrated that they need to come to the Emergency Department.  The cramps are typically mild and easily treated with pepto-bismol, ibuprofen, or tylenol.  When a child vomits, food and milk need to be withheld for 6 hours, and he or she given only clear liquids like gatorade, starting with small amounts to go easy on the stomach. Abdominal pain that has been going on for weeks and months is also not an emergency.  Pain going that long needs to be seen by the kid’s regular doctor, who can organize a methodic search for the cause, or refer the child to a specialist if the pain continues.  By definition, pain that lasts weeks is not an emergency-the child would have already needed hospitalization or surgery in the first few days of pain if it were.  Going to Emergency Departments for chronic pain means seeing a different doctor every time and having expensive, haphazard, thus and sometimes ineffective strategies for diagnosis and treatment.  Chronic pain is often caused by constipation, or anxiety, or a combination of these and other factors. What is an emergency?  The most common emergency with abdominal pain in children is appendicitis.  Appendicitis typically starts with pain, not vomiting and fever.  The pain is steady and slowly worsens.  It rarely comes and goes.  Later in the course, after the pain has moved to the right lower side, comes the fever and vomiting.  Diarrhea is unusual in appendicitis.  Appendicitis needs surgery, so if the child has steadily worsening pain, call your doctor or bring him in to the Emergency Department. Severe pain, where the kid is rolling about on the floor crying with pain, needs to come in.  This is often because of cramping from constipation, but pain that bad needs to be looked at.  Occasionally severe pain can be caused by something worse, like kidney stones in a teenager or a blockage in a toddler. Other worrisome signs with abdominal pain are vomiting for more than 8 hours.  Dehydration becomes a concern after that, and the parent should call the doctor to talk about it.  A child who becomes progressively more tired and lethargic is concerning.  This could mean dehydration or a worse infection than a stomach virus.  Finally, any child with abdominal pain and shortness of breath needs to come right in.  Again, this could mean a worsening infection or dehydration. So next time your child starts with some vomiting, has diarrhea with some cramps, relax.  It is probably a stomach virus, will run its course, and just needs some clear liquids and over-the-counter medicine like peptobismol or tylenol.  If your kid has pain that steadily worsens or is severe, call your doctor.  Your child too may need a visit from a surgeon. Posted in Belly Pain/Appendicitis | Leave a reply Belly Pain- Is it an Appendix? Posted on April 12, 2010 by klfydoctor 7 A common reason for parents to bring their kids to the ED is belly pain.  Doctor’s offices and “quick care” urgent care clinics also send us a lot of kids with belly pain.  Everyone has the same  basic concern- is it appendicitis?  Does the child need an operation? In this column and on my TV spot on KATC, I often encourage families to stay home or wait to see their doctor for things that are obviously not emergencies.  Runny noses, fevers, diarrhea, rashes, even ear pain- Stay home!  Give ibuprofen!  Belly pain, though, should not be waited on very long.  Belly pain lasting more than a few hours needs to be discussed with a doctor, first on the phone, and then in the office or E.D. What is appendicitis?  The appendix is a tiny pouch that usually hangs off your intestines in your right lower side.  Appendicitis is when poop gets trapped in the appendix, gets infected, and the appendix slowly swells like a boil.  With swelling and infection comes pain, fever, and nausea.  A “ruptured” appendix is when the appendix bursts and the pus and infection spread throughout the abdomen.  We always hope to diagnose appendicitis and get it out before rupture, but that is sometimes just not possible. Though most belly pains turn out to be stomach virus or constipation, the diagnosis of appendicitis can be tricky.   Early on appendicitis can act like stomach virus and fool the doctor.  Sometimes the child is admitted to the hospital, the doctors and surgeons debate and ponder, and finally days later the surgeon decides to take the patient to surgery for the pain.  Only then, with the patient opened up, does the surgeon look in and go “ah-ha” and make the diagnosis. With belly pain, first call your doctor.  Some doctors are comfortable making the diagnosis in the office and then sending the patient right to a surgeon.  Some refer the family to the ED for diagnosis.  Make sure you take your child to a hospital that cares for children and has surgeons available.  In Lafayette, that is Lafayette General Medical Center and usually Women’s and Children’s Hospital too. What does a child with appendicitis look like?  First, the pain starts as a steady, slowly worsening pain.  Often the pain starts in the middle of the belly, under the belly  button, and later is more in the right lower side.  Kids with appendicitis lose their appetite and sometimes vomit later in the illness.  They also often have later fevers.  This is usually unlike stomach virus, where kids vomit first, have early fevers, and have crampy belly pain that comes and goes away. At the hospital, the ED doctor and surgeon often make the diagnosis and decide on surgery by just taking a history (hearing the ”story” of the illness) and examining the child.  Few tests are needed besides a few blood tests.  CT scanning is usually unnecessary.  One estimate is that only 10% of appendicitis cases need a CT to make the diagnosis.  CT adds a lot of radiation exposure, and sometimes can miss an appendicitis or mislead the doctors with extraneous information. The surgery itself is usually uncomplicated and safe, as long as the appendix hasn’t ruptured.  The child often goes home in a day or two after surgery.  If the appendix has ruptured, that means recovery takes a week or two of antibiotics and care in the hospital. So if your child has belly pain, but is walking, smiling, eating and the pain goes away soon, it probably is not appendicitis.  If he or she starts with pain that is steady and worsening over some hours, come on in!

Posted on December 4, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply My wife’s nephew Jordan had colic bad.  In his first months of life he cried non-stop, only quieting in his swing.  His mom was so frazzled from fatigue and frustration that when my wife offered to babysit for a weekend,  she ran far and fast. My wife soon discovered that the swing had a wind-up motor (there were no electric swings in those days) that lasted 20 minutes.  That weekend she lived her sister’s life of sleeping in 20 minute increments.  She would wind up the spring, Jordan would sleep while rocking, and she would sleep too.  But when that spring wound down and Jordan creaked to a halt, he would snuffle, then squirm, then begin wailing.  My wife would wake up, roll over to the edge of the bed, crank up the spring, and both would go back to sleep for another brief spell.  Being awakened every 20 minutes for one night is bad enough, but imagine a whole weekend.  Or a whole month. Living with a colicky baby can be miserable and frustrating.  Colic is a phenomenon where baby in the first months of life cries a lot, for no apparent reason.  Babies feed well and grow, they are not sick with coughs or fevers, they poop and pee normally, yet they cry as if in pain.  Colic usually starts in the first few weeks of life, peeks at about one month old, and then slowly goes away.  Babies often start crying in the afternoon, cry all evening, and fall asleep sometime after midnight.  Some babies, like Jordan, cry around the clock. It’s almost easier to say what colic isn’t, rather than what it is.  Colic looks like gas pain, with babies cramping and pulling up their legs.  But no baby has yet been able to report to us: “Yes, this is gas pain I’m having.”  It isn’t problems with digesting formula; changing formulas seldom makes it better.  It isn’t constipation; baby’s pooping pattern doesn’t relate to the pain.  It isn’t reflux; spitting up doesn’t correlate with pain either, and reflux medication rarely helps. One thing colic certainly is, is stressful.  Parents worry that something is wrong, and frustrated about how to stop it.  They are sleep-deprived, worse than the usual new parent.  This makes some parents angry: at baby, at the world, at the helpless doctor with few answers. It’s a common worry for the pediatrician: Parents bring their baby in with a problem like colic, where baby cries and is unhappy.  We listen carefully to their story, we examine baby head-to-toe, looking for clues to why baby is hurting.  When we exhaust the other possibilities- ear infections, diaper rashes, thrush- we diagnose colic.  We tell the parents about colic, what to expect, and what to do about it.  Then comes the parental reaction we all fear, “That’s it doc?  That’s all you got?” A lot of pediatrics is like that- having to disappoint parents.  Colic, like cold viruses in babies, doesn’t have any snappy answers, any tests that say “Aha, this is it!”  There is no shazam medicine, no miracle antibiotic, that will make baby quit crying. Many medicines have been tried.  Mylicon, which is essentially baby Gas-X, some swear by.  There are other remedies like deewee, gripe water, chamomile. Science hasn’t shown any of these work.  Like we said above, reflux medicine hasn’t been shown to help either.  The only medicine that may help is Tylenol. What does help?  First, breast feeding.  Breast fed babies statistically have less chance of colic, and if they do have colic it’s less miserable than that of formula-fed babies. Second, basic baby comfort things like a pacifier or swaddling can help.  The most reliable way to stop colicky crying is a car ride. Something about the vibration and white-noise of the engine makes fussy babies calm.  You can simulate this at home- put baby in a swing with a white-noise maker going, or the vacuum or a fan. However, if baby is crying with other symptoms- fever, cough, worsening feeding, rash, call your doctor.  Inconsolably crying babies with other symptoms may have more concerning illnesses.  But if baby is feeding well, gaining weight, and well in every other way, then it’s into the car!  Good thing gas is cheap right now. Posted in Colic | Leave a reply Babies That Go Waaah in the Night Posted on April 7, 2011 by klfydoctor 1 My wife tells the story of how two of her nephews screamed non-stop for their whole first year of life.  Her sister and her husband were getting so crazy that she offered to watch the kids for a weekend so they could get a break.  My wife only half-believed that babies could cry that much but sure enough, the only time those babies didn’t cry all weekend was when they took a bottle, or were in the swing.  And in those days of wind-up swings, the spring only kept them rocking for twenty minutes before needing rewinding.  Thus at night no one got more than twenty minutes of sleep at a time! All babies cry.  Occasionally a baby is brought to us in Emergency because the baby is crying too much and parents want to know why.  More importantly, they want it to stop.  They are ready to tear their hair out with frustration because they have been to their pediatrician several times, have tried several treatments, and baby still cries all night.  Often that means baby has colic. Colic is a common baby problem- almost one-fifth of all babies have it.  These are babies who cry for more than 3 hours per day for more than 3 weeks, in the first 3 months of life.  Often they cry most in the evening.  That much crying can make parents crazy with worry and frustration, listening to the screaming and not being able to comfort baby.  Sometimes parents get so worked up that they are afraid they might hurt baby to stop the crying. Pediatricians try some easy fixes early on.  They may advise that formula-fed babies change formulas, in case of milk intolerance.  They may give medicines for gastric reflux, if they think that heart burn from reflux is the reason for pain.  Sometimes these things work, but for colic they don’t. One of the most frustrating things about colic is that in this day and age of cancer cures and antibiotics and MRIs, science still is not sure what colic is or what to do about it.  It seems like a gas problem when babies cry and cramp up, pull up their legs, grunt, and pass gas.  However, anti-gas medicines don’t help much.  There is some research in intestinal bacteria and probiotic treatment, but this is very preliminary.  People try all sorts of alternative medicines like fennel tea, chiropractic manipulation, herbal medicines, but none of that seems to help much either. Here is what we do know to help.  Breast feeding makes colic less common.  Swaddling baby in a blanket, rocking them, and pacifiers seems to help.  The ultimate way to calm a fussy baby is still a car ride in the car seat.  Swings and white-noise makers (like fans, clothes dryers, and purpose-made white noise makers) also often calm colicky babies. If baby is really driving you nuts and you think you might hurt baby- get help!  Get a neighbor or relative to watch baby for a while so you can calm down.  If you can’t do that, put baby in a safe place (baby bed, buckled into a car seat or swing) and get out of hearing range to calm down.  Letting baby cry won’t hurt them or give them a “complex.”  Heck, you haven’t been able to stop the crying anyway, so why not give yourself a break?  As my mom said, she had no baby-crying problem that wasn’t fixed by two closed doors between me and her.  And me and my brothers seemed to have turned out okay (but that is just our own opinion- others may differ). As always, call your pediatrician before going to Emergency for crying.  Most crying is not an emergency and your doctor can help you decide if it is.  Do you have a colic story or cure?  If so, send me a comment.  You might know something about colic that science doesn’t!

It’s mosquito season again- never far away in Louisiana.  Usually bites are harmless, causing some redness, itching, and swelling that goes away within hours.  Ten years ago mosquito bites were just a nuisance, but now the news is full of stories about Zika and Dengue, and remember West Nile virus?  So when to worry? Your 10 year-old son played outside this afternoon.  When he came in for supper he had two itchy, raised, red areas on his arms and one on his neck.  Other than some rubbing and scratching, he seems fine.  Should you be concerned? Not yet: your boy is behaving normally, has no fever or other symptoms besides the bites.  You tell him to stop scratching- good luck with that!  When mosquitoes bite, they inject an anesthetic so you don’t know they’re biting and can’t swat them.  But then later some people develop a tiny allergic reaction to that anesthetic, and thus the spot of swelling and itching.  And when kids itch, they scratch, and no words can stop that. To get rid of the itch,  use anti-histamines like Benadryl, Claritin, or Zyrtec.   Ibuprofen or Tylenol can take the edge off itching too, and can safely be taken with an anti-histamine.  Also, keep your kids fingernails cut short.  If they tear the skin with scratching, that broken skin is an entry for bacteria, and infections and pus can result.  If your child has extra sensitive or dry skin, keep it moisturized with lotion and moisturizing soap, making it less itchy and less easily torn by fingernails. Even better, keep those bites from happening!  Mosquito buzzing is no reason to stay inside all day playing video games.  Kids need exercise (besides their thumbs) to stay healthy, not to mention wearing them out so they’ll sleep at night.  Have your kids wear light, long sleeved clothing and pants, with cuffs tucked into socks.  Too hot for that, or too dorky for your kid?  Repellents with DEET or picaridin can help keep insects away.  Avoid being outside when mosquitoes are most active- dusk, dawn, and after rain. Here’s a different mosquito scenario than from our boy above.  Your teenage daughter goes on a mission trip to Central America with her church.  She was helping out at a clinic in a remote village, and gets some mosquito bites.  Two days after coming home she begins to feel bad- with fever, headaches, nausea.  Her body aches and she’s tired.  Knowing that many infections transmitted by mosquitoes get better on their own, you give her Tylenol and have her drink plenty of fluids.  So when to worry now? These days with Zika virus in the news, heck, you’re already worried!  So you take her to your doctor or the ER.  Most of the time though, these mosquito-borne infections are viruses that run their course and leave your daughter fine.  Occasionally, kids may need tests to look for one of the bad infections like West Nile, Dengue, or malaria. They may need fluids for dehydration or specific medicine for pain. Many countries in the Caribbean, Central America, or South America have increased risk for mosquito-borne diseases like Zika, Chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, Dengue, or malaria.  If you or your kids are working or vacationing there, preventing these illnesses is way better than getting them!  Sleep under mosquito netting, in a room with screens on the windows.  Air-conditioning helps: you can sleep in a more sealed room, and the cool air makes mosquitoes less active.  Use repellents and protective clothing as mentioned above. Before you go, check the Centers for Disease Control website ( www.cdc.gov ).  The CDC lists the disease risks for every country in the world, and what you need before you go.  If yellow fever is prevalent, get vaccinated for that.  For malaria prevention, the site tells you what antibiotic to get from your doctor, when to start taking it, and when to stop.  It’s a pretty cool site (at least we doctors think so), so check it out. Don’t let those mosquitoes disrupt your kids’s outdoor fun or travel plans.  Take these steps to help them have a great summer at home or on the road.  And so you don’t have to panic when you hear BZZZZZZ.

Many people don't know how severe a condition needs to be in order to visit a quick care clinic or emergency room, so why not come in anyway just in case? We know medical issues don't just pop up during normal business hours.  We are an after hours walk in clinic providing convenient quick care in the evening and on weekends. Our urgent care centers provide treatment for common illnesses and minor injuries.  While the hospital ER treats patients based on the severity of their conditions, not in order of who gets there first, our urgent care centers see patients on a ""first come first served"" basis, with limited wait time. Lafayette General provides quality medical care, on a walk-in basis, at three convenient locations: Lafayette, LA Youngsville, LA Carencro, LA Our walk in clinics are open seven days a week: Monday - Friday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Our only exceptions are closing on New Year's Day, Easter Sunday, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. When to Go to Urgent Care? Any cough or cold that does not get better in several days, or a cough that gets worse and is accompanied by a fever Migraines Low-grade fevers Rash/Skin Irritation especially if there is a fever Minor broken bones and sprains/strains Cuts that might need stitches Removal of stitches Minor burns Severe or constant vomiting or diarrhea Animal and insect bites Upper respiratory infection Sore throat Aches/Pains Allergies/Sinus Headache/Stomachache Earache Pink eye Painful urination Dehydration Lafayette General's Urgent Care Centers also offer immunizations, such as the flu shot , x-rays , lab draws, annual check-ups and employee physicals on a walk-in basis.

 colorectal screening kits will be provided and LGEC encourages 
consumers to take the ""test of life."" Pick one up at any one of the 18 
Acadiana Walgreens stores. It's an easy, hands-free test that checks 
for unseen blood in the stool, which can be an indication of other 
problems. Simply mail the results back to LGEC and the readings are 
reported back to you. Now in its sixth year, the program has grown from its first distribution of 100 kits to last year's impressive count of 2,700. Marsha
 Williamson, RN, nurse administrator at LGEC, spearheads the program, 
which began in 2008. ""Although the test kit cannot replace a 
colonoscopy, it's a good check for people under 50 with no family 
history of colon cancer, for those who have not had a colonscopy and for
 those who have had one and are not due for another 10 years,"" she says. Williamson
 credits Walgreens and District Manager Lee Jones for helping bring the 
campaign to new levels by organizing distribution and providing ongoing 
publicity during the month. Other key sponsors are KLFY TV-10, which helps raise awareness of the ""test for life,"" and Lowry's Printing. As
 part of the campaign, each physician at LGEC is giving away a free 
colonoscopy in a drawing. Winners get the colonoscopy, which includes 
physician and facility fees, anesthesia and any pathology services.

Posted on January 29, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply One of last year’s fun news stories was a 911 call from a man whose cat wouldn’t let him in his house.  After a three hour stand off, and after the police and 911 operator finished laughing themselves silly, an officer was dispatched and apparently talked the cat down. Similar absurdities happen in Emergency Medicine.  Once when I worked in Baltimore, a mom brought her child in for chapped lips.  Thinking that no one would come to the ED for such a minor thing, I searched for the “hidden agenda,” some underlying worry explaining mom’s thinking.  Like if her Uncle Frim had lip cancer and she feared her son had it too. However, after an exhaustive history, there was no such issue: her son simply had chapped lips. It’s sometimes difficult telling the public when to call 911 or not, and when to bring kids to the Emergency Department or not.  We want to encourage people to get emergency help so they don’t blow off potentially serious issues.  On the other hand, we don’t want the Emergency Department and EMS systems clogged with non-emergencies. Most pediatric ED visits are not emergencies, but families come for many reasons. First, parents get scared for their kids.  They love their kids and when they get sick or hurt, parents sometimes rush for help rather than call their doctor for advice or wait for an appointment. Often parents can’t get their kid seen in the office that day.  An appointment for next week doesn’t help when your child won’t stop vomiting, or needs x-rays.  Sometimes when the parent does call for advice, the mom is told to go to the ED, rather than office staff taking time to talk the situation through, giving advice that could keep the child home. Sometimes when a child gets sick or hurt, a doctor’s office or school is worried about caring for a potential emergency.  They aren’t used to emergencies and don’t want to miss something, or get sued. Almost daily we see kids in the Emergency Department who were in car crashes, seem fine, but the parents want them “checked out.”  You can’t fault this reasoning; they care about their kids and are worried.  However, when the “crash” involves cars backing into each other in a parking lot, and the child was strapped into a car seat, maybe an ED visit is overkill.  Unless the lot has cars speeding into their slots like the Indy 500 pit stop. Too often the ED is used as a walk-in clinic, rather than for true emergencies.  The point of this blog is to inform you about what real emergencies are, what can wait to see the doctor, and what you can take care of at home.  So let’s review common issues appropriate for the ED, and things that are not emergencies. Kids who are short of breath, tugging to breathe, belong in the ED.  Of course bring any children with possible broken bones, cuts that need stitches or won’t stop bleeding, or severe pain. When kids get lethargic (difficult to arouse), they need to get seen.  However, there are gradations of cuts and limb injuries, and lethargy: kids with fever get lethargic, but recover with anti-fever medicines.  If it isn’t obvious if it’s an emergency or not, call the doctor’s office.  If they can’t help, go to the column in this blog to the immediate right side of the page.  Click on your issue to read specifics about what is an emergency, and what can be handled at home. Things that are commonly not emergencies: fever, coughing, rashes.  Fever doesn’t hurt kids- it doesn’t cook their brains and is rarely associated with seizures.  The height of the fever doesn’t correlate with how sick the kid is either: a child with a 104 temperature isn’t sicker than a child with 101.  Coughing also isn’t an emergency- kids cough when they get colds and if they aren’t otherwise short of breath, it can wait.  Again, see the column to the right. This is a busy time of year for the Pediatric Emergency Departments, so use common sense when deciding to visit.  Use your doctor’s call line, or this blog when in doubt.  But if you still can’t decide, bring your child in. Better safe than sorry, but you can leave the chapped lips at home. Posted in Ambulance Calls , Appropriate ER visits , Fever | Leave a reply My Kid Has A Fever…Help!!! Posted on June 5, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Shauna Bienvenu, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. As a resident working in the Pediatric Emergency Department, I’ve noticed that “fever phobia” is pretty common.  Many parents rush into the ER when their child has a fever.  They’re afraid that fever is a sign of serious infection, and that a higher fever means it’s even more serious.  They’re afraid of the fever itself, that it will hurt their kid’s brain or cause seizures.  Fever can be scary for parents, but is actually harmless.  Yes, it’s harmless!  It feels bad, but doesn’t injure your child. Here’s the good news: fever is an important part of the body’s defense against infection.  Most infections that cause fever are minor and are “self limited,” meaning kids get over them on their own.  Most fevers go away within 72 hours. When your kid does have a fever, start by treating it at home.  Have her drink plenty of fluids.  If giving fruit juices, dilute with half water and half juice.  Children can eat and drink milk with a fever, but don’t force them.  Bland foods are better, such as breads, crackers, oatmeal, or pastas. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil) to make your child feel better.  Dress him or her in lightweight clothing and light blankets.  You can use lukewarm baths to help your kid feel better too, though a bath may not bring down the temp.  Don’t use ice baths or alcohol baths- these won’t help either, and can be dangerous. When giving medicine for fever, use the correct dosage.  A lot of parents are afraid to give too much, and end up not giving near enough to work.  The correct dose is based on the child’s weight and is on the medicine’s box, or on the internet.  Tylenol can be used every 4 hours and ibuprofen every 6 hours- more than that will not work any better. A common myth is that if your child feels warm, they must have a fever!  Children can feel warm for many reasons such as playing hard, crying, or hot weather.  Overdressing infants can make them seem warmer too.  If your child feels warm, check the temperature before calling your doctor or rushing to the Emergency Department.  If the child’s temperature is less than 100, that’s not a fever, no matter how warm she feels.  However, some parents are so afraid of fever that a thermometer won’t convince them- “98.6, no way!  He definitely has a fever- feel him!” Again, fevers are not bad for children.  Fever is a protective mechanism, helping fight infections.  If the fever does not come down or you cannot “break” the fever, this doesn’t mean it’s more serious.  Height of the fever doesn’t correlate with how sick the kid is either.  In other words, if a child has a temperature of 104, she isn’t necessarily sicker than a kid with a temp of 101.  How your child looks is what’s important, not the height of the temperature. So, when do you call your doctor or go to the ER?  Again, it’s how your child looks.  If a child has a fever, but is playful and drinking, then just treat the fever.  Your child may sleep more, not eat so well, and act miserable, but this can be okay too.  As long as he feels better after fever medicine (at a decent dose!), is drinking,  and is breathing comfortably, then things are fine. Talk to your child’s doctor or go the ER if your child is not alert after the fever is treated.  If your child is not drinking and urinating as much, this can be worrisome too.  If your child has trouble walking, cannot be easily awakened, seems confused, has difficulty breathing, has a bad headache, or has new rashes with bruising, get seen.  Infants under 3 months old with fever need to see the doctor too, as do kids with certain conditions like sickle cell disease. Yes, fevers are scary to parents, but they are usually not an emergency.  Of course, if you are worried call your doctor.  He or she can help you sort through your child’s symptoms and nip ”fever phobia” in the bud. Posted in Fever | Leave a reply Fever Is Not The Enemy! Posted on November 15, 2012 by klfydoctor 2 Its happening a lot this time of year.  Parents rush their kids into the Emergency Department- for fever.  When I get to the bedside, mom is sick with worry.  The child, however, is walking about the room, opening cabinets, tugging on the bed controls.  It seems the only problem the kid is having is not being able to release the bed brakes so he can race the stretcher up and down the hall. Its a cough and fever time of year.  The Emergency Departments and pediatric practices are full of sick kids.  Kids have been coughing on each other in school or day care for three months now, and the influenza virus has joined the mix.  Besides the amount of ill kids, the University Medical Center closed its Pediatric Department earlier this year due to state budget cuts, and thus there is one less place to bring children.  So what should you do with your child with a fever?  Keep them home! Fever is not an emergency.  Fever is a natural response by your body to fight off infection.  Just like you cook food to kill germs in it, your body gets hotter when you are infected to make it harder for the infection to grow in you.  This gives your immune system extra help to clean the infection out. So what do you do for your child’s fever?  Give them fever medicine, but give enough!   Another popular reason for parents to visit the Emergency Department is that when they gave ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, Pediacare), the fever did not go away.  This does not mean the fever or illness is extra bad, or that the medicine is no good.  After discussing dosing with the parents, the mom turns out to be afraid of overdosing their child, and then only gives a tiny amount.  Therefore they under-dose the kid, and no wonder the medicine did not work.  Don’t worry about overdosing with ibuprofen or acetaminophen- it is very hard to hurt a child with these medicines.  If you have trouble figuring out the dose from the instructions on the bottle, call your doctor.  The nurse on the phone can help you with dosing. When is a fever a worry?  As I tell my patients, its not the fever, or how high it is, or whether it goes away with medicine or not.  Again, as I have said before, it is not the fever that will hurt your child- it won’t cook his brain or make him have seizures. What is more important is how the child is acting.  Are they breathing normally?  Good!  Are they drinking and making urine?  Good!  Are they waking up and talking and with it?  Good!  These are the well enough-acting kids who can wait a few days before having to see a doctor, much less go to the Emergency Room. The time we worry about fever is when children ACT sick.     Are they getting short of breath, meaning they are pulling for their breath or breathing faster than normal?  Are they getting more and more tired and sleepy?  Are they drinking less and less?  Kids who get sicker and sicker are the ones who parents need to call their doctors about.  And if the doctors tell them to go the Emergency Department, come on in!  Also, newborns with fevers need to get seen right away too.  Newborns are at special risk for infections that older babies and children aren’t. So next time your child gets a fever, don’t run to Emergency.  If your doctor can’t see your child until the next day, it can wait!  Talk to your doctor on the phone to be sure.  Give ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and give enough.  Fever is not the enemy, it is actually your child’s friend. Posted in Fever | 2 Replies Fever Won’t Cook Your Baby’s Brain! Posted on June 18, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply Many parents fear that high fever will hurt their children.  A common visit to my Emergency Department often starts with “My baby had a fever of 103, so I rushed right in.”  Many times I look the toddler over and he is jumping up and down on the bed, pounding it with both feet.  Just how sick is this kid? After determining that the baby has no more serious condition than a virus or ear infection, I often start my talk with the parents with “fever won’t cook your baby’s brain,” which causes the parent to giggle nervously and say that that is exactly what they feared. Fever is actually a good thing- it is part of how your body fights infection.  Just like you heat food or wash in hot water to kill germs, your body sets its natual thermostat higher to help your immune system get rid of germs.  In fact, there are many renowned pediatricians who say we should not treat fever with Motrin or Tylenol because that may slow the recovery process! However, many moms have a story about how a friend or relative’s child died because of fever.  It is important to know that it was not the fever that hurt the baby, it was the infection that caused the fever that hurt the baby.  Fever is just another symptom of illness, it is not bad itself. What I tell parents is that the important thing about fever is not that the child has a fever, but how the child is acting with the fever.  Is the child short of breath?  Is the child difficult to wake up?  Does the child have a funny color?  Is the child drinking poorly?  Is the child under three months old with a fever?  These are the signs of serious illness, not the fever.  These are the real reasons to take a child to the Emergency Department. Next time your child has a fever and is free of those troubling symptoms, relax.  Give your child some Motrin or Tylenol and wait.  If your child is breathing comfortably, will wake up and talk to you, is drinking ok, then you can probably hold off coming to the Emergency Department.  You can usually even wait a day or two to see if the fever will go away on its own before going to the doctor’s office.  When in doubt, you can always call your doctor on the phone to ask if your child needs to get seen sooner.

Posted on May 22, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply Cancer.  It’s a diagnosis so feared that many are unable to even say the word. If someone does says it, they feel compelled to knock on wood, to ward cancer off like an evil spirit. In the Pediatric Emergency Department, the fear often becomes real when a child has a headache.  Kids get headaches just like adults, but with a kid parents worry if this could be the worst: is this a brain tumor? Fortunately, brain tumors are rare. When a child comes in with a headache, part of the pediatrician’s job is to acknowledge the parent’s fear so that we can alleviate the anxiety. The vast majority of child headaches are benign- viruses, stress, and migraines.  We discuss with the parents why their child does not have a brain tumor, so that they can smile, have a chuckle at their fear, and go “whew!” How we think about cancer has evolved dramatically over the past two generations.  40 years ago, cancer in a child was hard to talk about because it was a death sentence. The most common childhood cancers are leukemia and brain tumors.  When children were diagnosed with one of these, almost none survived.  It was not a “nice” death either, with bleeding, pain, bad smells, and slow deterioration. Then in the 1950s, doctor-scientists began to figure out how to treat the incurable disease. These doctors were brilliant, dedicated, and desperate.  They despaired of their small, suffering patients and were willing to try anything, hoping to learn how to win some lives back.  The experimental treatments were painful, seldom worked, and would be impossible to try today in our medical-legal climate.  But through years of agonizing trial-and-error, they did begin to learn, and begin to win. By the time I started training in 1989, treatment of leukemia was a tremendous success story.  The cure rate of these cancers had gone from 0% to over 90%.  There began new thinking about cancer. First, we had to begin to talk about it openly and honestly, so that we could diagnosis and begin to treat it.  Second, if the cancer couldn’t be cured, the task was to help the child and family accept death, and make that death as painless and “nice” as possible. Now we need to overcome our fear in order to learn about cancer.  The first cancer to discuss is the most common- leukemia. Leukemia is bone marrow cancer.  Bone marrow manufactures the blood cells: white blood cells to fight infection, red blood cells to carry life-giving oxyen throughout the body, and platelets that help make clots and stop bleeding.  Leukemia is bone marrow cells gone amok.  The cancerous marrow cells overgrow and crowd out good cells.  Instead of making the crucial blood products, the marrow cranks out tons of useless “blasts,” dummy white blood cells.  Leukemia has been called “liquid cancer,” as opposed to brain tumors and other “solid” tumors. The signs of leukemia relate to the lack of blood cells.  Without enough red blood cells, the patient becomes pale and fatigued.  Without platelets, he bruises easily and the bruises heal slowly.  Without working white blood cells, the child is easily infected and runs fevers. Fortunately, leukemia is easy to detect with a simple blood test: the CBC (Complete Blood Count of the three kinds of blood cells). The next most common childhood cancer is brain tumors.  Most headaches can be diagnosed as benign by history and a neurologic exam, without a CT scan.  CT scan can see tumors, but uses a lot of radiation and thus can cause cancer itself.  We don’t use it unless we must.  Benign headaches come and go, are easily treated with ibuprofen and tylenol, and are easily attributed to other causes. “Red flags” for brain cancer are headaches that wake the child at night and early morning, vomiting with headache, and headaches that are steady and don’t come and go.  Brain cancer is much harder to treat than leukemia, often requiring surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, and the cure rates are less optimistic. So If you want to face your fear and learn even more about childhood cancer, go to Kidshealth.org. This site has well written and detailed information for parents, to help you say the word.

Since milk was expensive and filling, they substituted Kool-aid for my habit.  Thus my memories of Dr. Tarentino, his eyes, and the scream of the drill. We non-dentist doctors see lots of tooth problems in the Emergency Department.  There are too many kids out there with bad dental hygiene, which leads to cavities, which leads to tooth pain and infection.  Yet only a few minutes per day of tooth care prevents such misery.  First, supervise your kid’s brushing.  Many parents tell their kids to go brush their teeth, and minutes later the child reports- job done!  But how good a job?  When kids are left alone to brush, they often just do a couple of strokes on a couple of teeth before moving on.  From an early age, be there to watch your kids brush every time, insuring that they get all tooth surfaces, brushing gently instead of scrubbing like they were taking off old paint. Start tooth care at an early age.  After all, your kids get teeth in the first year of life.  Get them used to brushing as soon as they have teeth, again, gently!  You don’t want it to hurt and make them hate brushing.  If it is a habit when they are so young, it gets ingrained as a habit for the rest of their lives.  Bring them to the dentist early as well- as young as age two. Then they learn that the dentist can be fun and every dental visit won’t mean pain. Unlike my parents, avoid that sugary diet.  We all have bacteria in our mouths, no matter how much brushing and flossing. Dental hygiene keeps down that bacteria that hurts our teeth.  Sugars in our diet feed that bacteria, which turn that sugar into acids which burn into our teeth.  Those burn holes are cavities. It always seems that the tooth pain cases come in at night.  The lights are down, the house is finally quiet, there are no more distractions for a kid.  WIth the quiet of bedtime comes the realization that something has been hurting- ouch, its my tooth!  The child cries and the mom finally has time to notice that the side of the child’s face is swollen. They rush into the Emergency Department with their tooth infection. However, dental infections are not sudden emergencies.  By their very nature, they are slow-growing illnesses.  It starts with a cavity.  Over weeks and months, the mouth bacteria that started the cavity chew deeper into the tooth.  The cavity finally gets deep enough to infect the gums.  The infection causes inflammation, swelling, and terrible pain in one of the most sensitive parts of the body. Actually, dental infections don’t start with a cavity.  They start with bad mouth care. As we mentioned above, unsupervised brushing, along with not flossing and too much sugar, allow mouth bacteria to get out of hand and begin to eat into the child’s tooth surfaces. Tooth infections also start with children not getting enough flouride in their diet. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry is very clear on the science- communities with flouride in their water save lots of money and anguish not having to care for so many rotten, painful teeth.  In places where the water is not flouridated (Louisiana), the AADP recommends flouride supplements for children.  In other words, Louisiana children should take flouride just like they would take any other vitamin. Back to my parents, who let me toddle about with a kool-aid bottle in my mouth and thus support my childhood dentist’s practice .  My parents were wonderful people who did more good in the world than I can ever hope to approach.  They raised three happy successful boys. Just don’t follow their lead in their third son’s dental hygiene. Posted in Dental infections | Leave a reply Doctors Doing Dentistry? Posted on March 5, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply Sometimes we emergency doctors are called upon to temporarily be dentists.  Teeth  get knocked out in injuries, and we have to tend to the tooth as well as the other, more doctory injuries.  It makes us a little uncomfortable- there is a whole profession dedicated to mouth care, and we are by comparison rank amateurs.  Then there is the non-emergency that always makes us groan in frustration, the dental infection. Dental infections in the Emergency Department make us groan because their very nature is not an emergency.  Dental infections happen in slow motion.  They start with cavities, which take months to grow.  They are highly preventable- doesn’t everyone brush their teeth?  And when pain starts, the pain can be taken care of with ibuprofen and tylenol until the next dentist visit- no need to clog the Emergency Department! So here are the details to take care of dental infections.  Step one- don’t have one.  Make sure your kid brushes his teeth twice daily.  And with kids from age 3 to 10, don’t always take their word for it.  Parents need to observe that their child brushes all surfaces carefully, twice daily.  I’ve seen plenty of parents who say their kids brush their teeth, but one look in the mouth tells me that maybe what the kid is doing is a quick one-two on a few teeth and done!  Older kids should learn to floss too. Kids need to have lower sugar diets, for their teeth as well as their waistline.  No sodas, candy, packaged sweets in the house at all!  That high sugar content destroys teeth as well as general health.  Finally, all kids over age 3 should have check-ups with the dentist twice per year.  Dentists can spot and treat cavities before they become big problems. Once a cavity gets big enough though, bacteria get into the deeper tooth and gum tissue.  Then the gums swell with infection, and it hurts! Then the tooth really needs a dentist.  The dentist can prescribe an antibiotic to clean up the infection and plan about repairing the damage.  In the mean time, pain medicine like ibuprofen or tylenol can make your child’s life a lot easier.  Occasionally, stronger medicines can be prescribed for bedtime pain.  But of course, to take care of the above, you have to have a dentist !  If you don’t have one for your three-year old, get one now. Preventing dental infections is easy, if you do a little work in prevention.  Teach your kids to brush their teeth and floss, and be sure with your own eyes that they do it at least twice per day.  Again, do not even bring temptation into the house- don’t buy sodas and sugary snacks.  Finally, have a dentist.  That way, you don’t have to have some dumb emergency doctor pretend that he is one.

Posted on June 30, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Claire Ronkartz, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s a classic medical board question: “A two-year old visiting her grandparents’ is found with some blood pressure pills.  What is the best first step managing this patient?” Though I’ve answered this questions many times on tests, I was still at a loss when it really happened!  My two year-old had discovered some luggage with unsecured medication inside, and was mouthing one when we came upon her. So I called Poison Control (stop reading now and write down this number: 1-800-222-1222). They advised a trip to the Emergency Department, where our girl drank an activated charcoal mix, was watched for some hours, and we went home. Although we thought we had meticulously placed all medications out of reach, in locked containers, accidents still happen.  So when your child begins crawling (or even after!), it’s a good time to think about child-proofing.  From button batteries to cosmetics and talcum powder, a young adult’s first “grown-up” house, when they have kids, can be a house-of-horrors for youngsters.  The newest hazard is laundry-detergent pods. Designed for ease of use by adults, these tasty-looking, colorful gems can burn mouths and throats and eyes, causing vomiting and breathing difficulty. Do they have to make them look so good to eat? The best way to toddler-proof your house is to be a toddler.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl through every square-inch of your house.  Open every cabinet and drawer you can reach, and put every single thing you find in your mouth.  If you don’t dare eat what you grab, it needs to be somewhere safer.  Then from your hands and knees, look up. What’s above you that looks attractive, or even just mildly fun to play with? Find something to climb on- a kitchen step-stool, chair, or ottoman.  Can you push it over and crawl up within reach of what you see?  Grab the boiling pot.  Eat the medication sitting on the counter.  Absurd as this sounds, if it can be done, a toddler has already done so in the past, and will in the future.  Make sure it’s not your’s. Now that you’ve done a decent job of making home safe for your little one, you may feel adventurous and head out for vacation, or maybe just Wal-Mart.  One such trip to the store nearly ended in tragedy for me.  My child launched herself out of the shopping cart in the one second it took to reach for some salad dressing.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed her as she tumbled out head-first!  From then on she was seated and belted in the cart. While that’s not as fun as shopping cart surfing, it may save a trip to the the ER. Going out with toddlers poses a new set of risks than your home.  Perhaps most important when you are out is safety around cars, moving or parked. Every week in the U.S., at least 50 children are backed over in driveways and parking lots. LIttle ones who dart outside to say goodbye often go unseen by a driver when the vehicle is set in motion. Many times the driver is a parent, relative, or neighbor. Following a few simple tips can protect your family from this tragedy.  Teach children that parked cars may move at any time.  Let them know that even if they see the vehicle, the driver may not see them.  Always hold a child’s hand in the parking lot. Teach them never to play in, around, or especially behind any vehicle.  Be especially vigilant when someone else is leaving the house and driving away.  Outside house doors should be toddler-proofed. The world of baby safety can be overwhelming.  And now manufacturers prey on your fears, offering lots of products- toilet bowl locks, outlet plugs, stove knob covers, baby gates, etc.  While some of these items may be helpful, doing the simple things we’ve discussed above goes a long way.  The last thing to do is be prepared for an emergency: post or put in your phone the Poison Control number (again, 1-800-222-1222).  Take a CPR/Heimlich class.  Read the books.  Know the location of your nearest child-capable ER.  And for goodness sake don’t buy those stupid detergent pods. Posted in Poisoning Prevention | Leave a reply Hospitals Are Cool Posted on June 9, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply I think hospitals are cool.  When I was a kid and went to visit someone, I was impressed by the big, maze-like structures, mysterious things going on inside.  The halls were full of strange smells, odd noises, futuristic equipment.  When I got older and entered the profession myself, they became my work home, magnificent buildings dedicated to researching and combating illness and death. Many have the opposite feeling- they hate hospitals.  When I meet friends occasionally at work, I’ll see them twitch and glance about.  ”What’s wrong?” I’ll ask. “Hospitals give me the willies,” they’ll say, looking as if they expect the mummy or Frankenstein monster to pop out of, say, the Radiology suite. I see their point.  Hospitals are places where people go when they’re suffering. You hear moans of pain from rooms, overhead calls for “Code Trauma” and “Code Blue,” and staff talking gravely in hushed tones.  Hospitals are also easy places to get lost in. They grow organically.  Is there a new specialty and technology? Throw up a new wing over here. Need more beds?  Stick an annex there.  They’re maze-like not to purposely confuse outsiders; that’s just how they evolve. Hospitals are certainly safer than in the past.  They’re no longer places where people regularly catch infections, or get the wrong limb sawn off. Initiatives in the last decades have made medicine as safety-conscious as aviation. Checklists, safety-training, and protocols have erased much of the haphazardness of medicine.  Patient safety is now as much of staff education as drawing blood or using the computer. You can help make your kid’s hospital stay safer too.  First, choose a hospital that’s appropriate for kids.  Some hospitals take care of lots of kids, some don’t.  Second, choose an academic hospital- one that’s affiliated with a medical school and trains medical students and residents.  Statistically, patients at teaching hospitals do better- have more accurate diagnoses, go home sooner, and generally get better care.  There is something about that environment, where multiple doctors at various levels of training put their heads together, discuss cases, teach each other, that helps them figure out what’s wrong. In the Emergency Department at Lafayette General, I occasionally interact with one bunch of those doctor teams, the surgeons.  Surgery teams are an odd bunch.  Busy, harassed by nurses and non-surgeons like me, they bustle around in packs of five or six. They come in all sizes, levels of training, and stages of grooming; tall, short, medical students, residents, some with hair and scrubs rumpled like they’re just out of bed, some coiffed and wearing clean, starched lab coats.  Their boss is the Attending, the surgery professor who breezes into patient rooms with authority and bon vivant, reassuring all that they’ve got it managed, their minions scribbling down orders in their wake.  Not the pretty picture seen on Grey’s Anatomy. LIke we discussed above, being a patient in “academic” institutions like Lafayette General or University Hospital and Clinics has advantages.  Patients get better quicker when they have more than one doctor puzzling over their cases, discussing it with each other, researching together.  However, keeping all those doctors straight can be tough for patients, and parents.  Which doctor is which specialist, responsible for which issue? It’s always a good idea for a patient to have an “advocate.”  Best if this person has some medical knowledge, and can keep everything straight.  Usually pediatric patients come with an advocate already- their parents.  However, parents are also emotionally involved with their child’s case, worried sick.  Already overwhelmed, often the parent needs a cool-headed advocate themselves. There’s a lot for a patient, parent, and advocate to keep straight, besides which doctor is responsible for what.  There are multiple medications and tests.  Where are we with the diagnosis, what’s the treatment plan?  And did you wash your hands before touching my child? These are important things to monitor.  Even with computer-controlled drug dispensing, you still want to ensure that your child is getting the right medication and the right dose. The radiology tech comes to pick up your child for xrays- ask why this test, what will we learn from it? So after you and your pediatrician pick your hospital, and your child must stay, have an advocate to help you navigate the complexities of medical care.  And to keep all those characters in scrubs straight. Posted in Surviving Hospital Stays | Leave a reply Real Animals Are Not Cartoons Posted on June 2, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Crystal Davis, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child. Posted in Animal Bites , Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply Drama In Real Life Posted on May 19, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply April 29th was a bad day in Lafayette.  Around midnight at Festival Internationale, two people began arguing.  Possibly fueled by alcohol, the fight escalated, someone pulled a gun, and one person ended up dead, and two injured by stray shots. Interpersonal drama brings many kids to the Emergency Department too, particularly teenagers. Someone says the wrong thing, feelings are hurt, punches are exchanged, and we see the ensuing facial and head injuries.  Teens are particularly vulnerable to these escalations.  Already at an emotional age, with hormones surging, feelings are raw and easily chafed. Teens are also often in the early stages of learning conflict resolution. They are unskilled in managing feelings and arguments without resorting to shouting and violence. Several outside forces can inhibit teens from maturing into rational adults too.  A lot of media these days portrays immature behavior as something fun to watch and emulate. Reality TV consists of knuckleheads gossiping about each other on camera, making wars out of simple disagreements.  Then the assailants confront each other and scream obscenities for the enjoyment of the TV audience.  And the combatants are always so good-looking, just like teens want to be. Social media amplifies drama as well.  When I see fights brewing at festivals, it’s not just two teens having a tiff.  There’s usually a crowd of “friends” swirling around, egging them on, joining the shouting.  With social media, the crowd is even bigger, with unlimited gawkers available through screens and sites, taking sides, trading barbs. Simple arguments become electronically-enabled riots. Some teens learn poor conflict resolution at home too.  When some parents fight, their negotiating skills look like the Jerry Springer show. Rather than a calm discussion of differences, these parents try to intentionally hurt the other’s feelings, verbally “aiming to kill,” instead of speaking respectfully.  When kids grow up living with such behavior, they rarely learn a better way for themselves. Like we discussed above, social media can fuel conflicts between people.  Once on Facebook, I saw a picture of a friend’s teenage son at a party.  His round smiling face, his arms draped around two friends, reminded me of actor Jonah Hill  (a cute Jonah Hill, not the overweight creep he sometimes portrays). So, bonehead that I can be, I said so in a comment. The backlash from he and his parents, and my wife, still makes me cringe with embarrassment. Thus one problem with social media: it’s easier to commit a social faux pas with a keyboard.  When you’re face to face with a person, you naturally edit what you say, to not offend.  There’s non-verbal cues that help you to not say dreadful things. This in-person behavioral check doesn’t operate when interacting online. Secondly, when you’re angry at another person, this social media disconnect makes it easier to intentionally wound.  In World War II, fighter pilots were rarely troubled by killing their enemies, though viciously machine-gunning each other in one-on-one combat.  This was because they concentrated on the other plane, not the pilot inside. Likewise today, it’s easier to say the meanest thing that comes to mind online, because you’re saying it to a machine. But screens are like fighter planes- there’s a real person hidden inside that gets hurt. So how can you counter the forces of Reality TV and on-line depersonalization, that turn your teen into a screaming drama king or queen?  Begin before your child’s a teen. In pre-teen years, games should be played less on screens, and more face-to-face. Board and card games, tag and backyard ball, are all conflict-resolution exercises for kids. Negotiating the rules, playing fair, keeping friends, all happen in those arenas, not in video games. You must also model good behavior yourself.  Parents should have arguments that aren’t death matches, but calm settlings of differences. Feeling wronged and needing vengeance are innate human traits- show your kids how you bypass those cruder motivations, to stay friendly. Finally, texting and messaging are certainly convenient, but elementary school kids should spend more time together in person than on screens. Phone and computer time should be limited, like limiting how much candy kids eat. And explain that there’s real people on the other side of the screen, not computer-generated enemies.  Then it’s easier to avoid comparing someone to Jonah Hill. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Explosive Babies Posted on May 5, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days! Posted in Diarrhea , Vomiting | Leave a reply Throw Like a Girl Posted on April 6, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Corey Gardner, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “You can’t beat me!” yelled Jacob, the ringleader of the third-grade boys who controlled the playground at recess.  He was yelling at me, the scrawny little thing in the ankle-length blue dress with flowers on it. “Oh yes she can, and she will, even in that dress,” countered my friend Reggie.  I stood silently, waiting for the race to start.  Reggie and I had played lots of tag and touch football, he knew my speed, and that no dress would hamper it.  With the distance marked and the rules set, we lined up.  ”Go!”  I took off, blue skirt streaming behind me like a sail. Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. Posted in Play time , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply High Anxiety Posted on March 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My son’s transcript showed he had failed Business Law, a bad start for a kid considering applying to law school for…business law.  After emailing his professor to ask the particulars, he stumbled through the day in a haze of misery.  When he found himself enjoying something- a joke or nice weather, the happiness was quickly extinguished by the thought, “I’ve failed.”  One big worry: how was he going to explain this in a law school interview? Later that afternoon his professor replied- it was just a mistake. My son’s final exam grade had not been entered into the system yet, which triggered the fail mark.  It would be fixed, and my son breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  But it took some time to shake that feeling of dread that haunted him for half the day.  Anxiety can be sticky. Many teens, and elementary school kids too, are plagued by anxiety.  There’s school- worry about grades, fear of bullying, tense relations with teachers.  Home can make a kid anxious too- divorce, yelling, sometimes abuse. Many kids have concerns about their neighborhood- they have to live with the threat of crime, violence, and drug dealers on the corner.  Finally, kids see the news too, and worry about the world.  They hear stories about environmental collapse, threat of deadly epidemics, and the possibility of nuclear armageddon. We are born with the tendency to be anxious.  Anxiety is a motivator cultivated by evolution, keeping us from getting eaten.  Worried about that sabre-toothed tiger eyeing you?  Good, run away!  Even animals as primitive as lizards have anxiety.  Just approach one, watch it twitch and scuttle about, before tearing off. Some kids and adults are better at handling anxiety than others.  And many kids have manifestations of anxiety that look like illness.  That’s when we see them in the Emergency Department.  Sometimes the signs in kids are subtle- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue.  Sometimes they have more concerning symptoms, like chest pain or fainting. And occasionally we see true panic attacks. When I was in high school, worried about getting grades good enough to be a doctor, I failed a french test.  The big red “F” on the paper burned into my brain at first period. But it wasn’t until fifth period that I became shaky, broke out in sweat, and was led sobbing to the nurse.  She called my parents to admonish them about putting too much pressure on me.  My mom replied, “It’s not us!  The stupid doctor thing is all his idea!” Anxiety can make kids short of breath, and thus parents bring them to the Emergency Department. Some are just hyperventilating, but kids with asthma can have true attacks triggered by anxiety.  In fact, in the mid-twentieth century, when medicine was full of freudian theory, many thought asthma was a psychological disorder.  Even in the face of real wheezing, the noise was attributed to patients’ “suppressed cries for help”- wheezing was those cries fighting to get out. Fortunately, asthma is now recognized as true disease. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a panic attack and medical emergencies like asthma.  Both kids have trouble breathing.  Both complain about chest pain and tightness.  And whether their shortness of breath is due to airway narrowing or panic, either kid looks anxious!  Occasionally it can be tough for even doctors to tell panic attacks and asthma apart, despite stethoscopes and oxygen monitoring. How do we manage anxiety?  Kids handle anxiety differently.  Some aren’t bothered by stress, those proverbial ducks letting worries roll off their backs like water.  But some need help.  Counseling can help kids tell the difference between true medical problems like headaches and stomachaches, and those symptoms being triggered by worry. Many don’t recognize when they’re having anxiety, and knowing if you’re anxious, and why, is a big step in coping with it. Counselors can also help kids identify management strategies.  For some, exercise helps “burn off” anxiety.  For others it’s prayer, meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques.  A few kids need medication, to temporarily get them through rough patches as they learn to cope. If you think your child is anxious, talk to them about their feelings, and maybe see their doctor to explore it more.  You want to do that before worry becomes panic attacks, and needing to come see me. Posted in Anxiety | Leave a reply Sore Throats Hurt! Posted on March 10, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chris Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in  Lafayette. Dreaded words at 7 pm on Friday night: “Mommy, Daddy, my throat hurts.”  Doctor’s closed, nowhere to turn.  It’s a common complaint, especially in my house with three girls. You’ve had sore throats yourself, and know-they hurt! Pharyngitis- doctor talk for throat inflammation- accounts for about 12 million office and ER visits yearly.  Pharyngitis has two main causes- viral (about 85% of cases), and bacterial (about 15%).  Many viruses cause sore throats, like adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza (“the flu”).  The most common bacteria is Group A Streptococcus, a.k.a. Strep Throat. It’s hard to tell the difference between strep and viral pharyngitis.  Besides throat pain, both cause headache, fever, and fatigue.  However, viruses tend to have more cough and runny nose.  But having those doesn’t exclude strep! There’s a few rules for doctors to separate the two.  First, strep throat happens mostly after age 3- red throats in babies and toddlers are rarely bacterial.  Second, if the child has a fine-bumpy, sand-papery rash on the trunk and face, that’s the “scarlet fever” of strep. The most important rule is that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it’s tough to differentiate the two without a strep test. The test is a throat swab that indicates if strep bacteria is present. It’s a good test, but not perfect, catching about 85% of strep throats.  Thus your doctor must weigh the symptoms, the exam, AND the strep test to decide if your child has strep.  If it’s strep, he needs an antibiotic.  If it’s viral, antibiotics don’t kill viruses. This is the kicker for parents.  Sore throats hurt, and everyone wants them gone. Many want antibiotics, thinking they will help.  But they won’t stop viruses, and we don’t give unnecessary antibiotics for good reasons.  Antibiotics have side effects- yeast infections, stomach upset, and possibly allergic reactions.  Most importantly, when your body is exposed to antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotics, and when you do need them to fight that bacteria, they won’t work. We’ve all had throat pain, and it’s miserable.  Dr. Hamilton tells of having yearly sore throats as a teenager.  When he got them, he remembers praying for the pain to go, counting the days of misery, and vowing to never again take feeling good for granted! Like we mentioned above, there’s no cure for viral sore throats.  The virus must run it’s course, typically 2 to 4 days.  If it’s a bacterial strep throat, which again is the minority of cases, only then will an antibiotic help.  So how to treat those viral illnesses that your child must “ride out?” Dr. Hamilton doesn’t remember taking medicine for his sore throats, besides throat sprays and lozenges.  And often when we see kids in the Emergency Department, parents haven’t given anything for pain either.  For your child’s sake, please do! There’s two medicines for pain and fever, perfectly safe for kids: Acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).  These come in many forms and flavors to make them easier for kids to take- liquids, chewable tabs; and for toddlers who spit out medicine instead of swallowing, acetaminophen rectal suppositories. No prescription necessary. Many parents, afraid to overdose their kids, don’t give enough medicine for the pain or fever.  Again, it’s quite safe to give what’s advised on the box for your child’s age or weight.  Still unsure?  Call your doctor’s office to double-check dosing. Give lots of fluids to help your kid feel better.  She may not eat much, and that’s okay. Fluids are more important, and she’s not going to starve in a few days.  If she does want food, light meals are best, like grits, oatmeal, or soup.  Popsicles and ice cream can soothe throats too. Keep your child out of school or daycare- don’t let them spread the illness to others. They won’t feel like learning anyway.  If your child has strep, they must stay out of school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, since it’s highly contagious. If your kid keeps getting strep after strep infection, your doctor can refer him to an ENT surgeon for tonsillectomy.  For the vast majority of sore throats though, 2 to 4 days and things will pass.  Push fluids, give pain medicine, and don’t take feeling good for granted again. Posted in Sore throat | Leave a reply Training Dogs and Toddlers Posted on February 23, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply My feisty little poodle, Milou, is all dog.  He’ll fetch endlessly, race around the yard chasing squirrels, and occasionally catch one in a lightning-fast wrestling match. Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog!

The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning.

RSV- Don’t Panic? Posted on February 4, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Brian Allen and Chris Fontenot, Family Practice residents at University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Winter- the season of holidays, travel, and people congregating indoors. Friends and family share hugs, gifts, food, and germs.  Just as common as sharing good tidings and Mardi Gras are those three letters that strike fear into parents: RSV. RSV, or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, is the most common cause of a condition called Bronchiolitis.  Bronchiolitis is an illness in babies and toddlers where the smallest airways in the lungs get inflamed, decreasing oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Worsening inflammation causes a “whistling” sound as the air squeaks through those narrowed airways, a.k.a. wheezing. Anyone can get RSV.  For people over age 2 and adults, it’s simply a cold.  Only babies under age 2 get bronchiolitis.  Even then, if your kid has RSV, don’t panic. Most babies have only a cold as well. RSV is rampant from November through April, particularly in January and February.  Also know that kids don’t stay immune to RSV: some unlucky babies get it twice in a season! The basic symptoms of RSV are runny nose and congestion, cough, fever, and decreased appetite.  Babies with colds can have trouble feeding, because clogged noses make it hard to suck the bottle or breast, and breath. More concerning signs of RSV, when we call it bronchiolitis, are rapid breathing (breathing 60-80 times per minute), wheezing, and worsening feeding.  Kids may have “retractions,” where the skin over the ribcage sucks in as they tug in breaths. Infants may grunt with every breath. Children with grunting, retractions, fast breathing, or worsening drinking need attention immediately. RSV is highly contagious.  It travels on water droplets that are coughed, sneezed, or breathed out.  The virus lasts up to two hours after landing on surfaces like furniture and counters, where others can unknowingly touch, pick it up, and infect themselves. “Your child tested positive for RSV” is a painful phrase for parents.  Parents ask, “Are you sure,” and “Will she have to stay in the hospital?”  T he answer to “Are you sure”, weirdly, doesn’t matter!  As we alluded above, RSV isn’t the only virus to cause bronchiolitis, that condition with coughing, fever, wheezing, and  congestion- many others cause it too.  We don’t recommend testing most kids for RSV, since whether the test is positive or negative, what’s important is how your child is handling bronchiolitis, not which virus caused it. The mainstay of treatment is “supportive care.”  The first support is hydration.  It’s important that children drink plenty, to keep mucus moist, thin, and easy to handle. When an infant or toddler can’t drink because of congestion, they begin to dehydrate.  Their mucus gets dried and sticky and gums up their already inflamed airways. Breast milk or formula are best, but extra clear fluids can help.  Pedialyte is a good option for infants; its designed to hydrate babies if they can’t handle milk.  Babies tend to vomit with bronchiolitis when they gag on mucus and have upset stomachs from swallowing it, and Pedialyte is easier to absorb than milk. However, Pedialyte tastes a little too salty for older children, so these kids can hydrate with dilute juices and sports drinks.  If a kid just won’t drink, he may need admission for IV fluids. Breathing also needs support.  Bedside humidifiers and nasal saline may help hydrate and thin mucus.  Elevating the head helps noses and upper airways stay clear too. When babies starts to struggle to breathe like we discussed above, need oxygen and other respiratory support, it’s time for admission.  Unfortunately, nebulizer breathing treatments don’t help.  Breathing treatments are often prescribed with bronchiolitis since the symptoms look like asthma, which treatments do help.  However, multiple studies have shown that nebulizers for bronchiolitis are a waste of time and money. Finally, keeping your child isolated is important for others to not get RSV- it’s highly contagious, and the cough and “viral shedding” last for weeks.  No daycare until baby is fever free and coughing much less. So don’t panic if your child has RSV. Like we said above, most kids will just have a nasty cold, only a few need hospitalization.  Fever medicine, fluids, patience, and TLC usually take care of it. Posted in Colds in Babies , RSV/Bronchiolitis | Leave a reply Whaddya Mean “It’s Just A Virus?” Posted on September 26, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply Some parents are disappointed with the diagnosis “virus” and not getting antibiotics. The only two times in my career a parent has outright yelled in my face were when I didn’t prescribe antibiotics. Today’s guest columnist, Dr. Seth Koster, explains viruses and when antibiotics are needed.  Dr. Koster is a resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. A lot of parents aren’t sure what to expect with their first child.  Did he just cough?  He sneezed twice, is that bad?  Do I need to go to the doctor?  Some things are common, yet seem complicated.  Let’s talk about some common conditions that are usually a virus that get better with a little TLC, and some “red flags,” things that need to be checked right away. I think my kid is wheezing, should I bring her in? Many parents hear baby make funny sounds, and call it wheezing.  Sometimes the sound they are trying to describe is the rattling of nose congestion.  True wheezing that we worry about is a whistling, gaspy tone in the lungs.  Either way you would be safe calling your doctor for a next day appointment if the wheezing doesn’t get better.  But if your child seems to be breathing fast or is having to pull in breaths, then he needs to be seen right away. The vast majority of colds and coughs are viral.  Even with true wheezing, this is usually a virus and not pneumonia, and antibiotics won’t help.  Hundreds of viruses cause coughs and runny noses and wheezing: adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and many more.  Antibiotics do not kill viruses.  What kids with these need is supportive care, meaning fluids and fever and pain medicine.  If they get really sick with wheezing and shortness of breath, they may need IV fluids, breathing treatments, and observation in the hospital. My child is pulling at his ears.  Does she need antibiotics? Most of the time “ear pulling” is not from ear infection.  Kids pull on their ears when they are stuffy from congestion, if they have a headache, or some kids just play with their ears.  If the child is not fussy and doesn’t have fever, they don’t have to see the doctor. What if she has fever-rush her to the Emergency Department?  No.  Ear infections may hurt, but that can be controlled with ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) for fever and pain.  Over 70% of ear infections are viral and don’t need antibiotics.  That being said, if your child is having ear pain and fever, see your doctor.  After an exam the doctor can decide if antibiotics or pain drops will help.  But ear pain is rarely an emergency that can’t wait until tomorrow. My child is vomiting, what to do? Whether vomiting needs to be checked out by the doctor depends on how much and how long.  Some kids are brought in to the ER when they vomit only once or twice, or only for a few hours. However, that is not enough time for a child to get dehydrated, and most will quit vomiting soon after. A simple “stomach virus” is usually not serious and will resolve in 1-3 days.  If the child vomits, wait an hour for his stomach to settle, then start clear liquids (gatorade, dilute juice, pedialyte), sipping slowly.  After the child has stopped vomiting for about 6 hours, you can start bland foods.  No fast food.  If your child has a fever, ibuprofen or acetaminophen will help with that. For most stomach illnesses antibiotics will not help, and even make vomiting and diarrhea worse. So when does your child need to be seen?  If she is having worsening belly pain, that is worrisome.  If your child is vomiting all day or is vomiting blood or dark green, bring them in.  If your kid is having diarrhea for more than a week, that is one of the few times an antibiotic may help, since that may be a bacterial illness and not a virus. Your child will get sick, there’s no avoiding it.  You usually don’t need antibiotics to treat them.  Most of the time your kid just needs rest, fluids, ibuprofen, and TLC. Posted in Antibiotic Usage , Colds in Babies | Leave a reply My Baby Is Choking In Her Sleep! Posted on June 19, 2009 by klfydoctor 25 A frantic mom rushes up to the Triage window in the Emergency Department, her eyes wild.  “My baby is choking!” she cries.  The staff scramble to get the baby in back and assessed. Yet in the mom’s arms is a pink, calm infant.  After a few moments of reassurance by the triage nurse, the mom begins to breathe normally.  Thus begins a common evening visit to the ED. Many moms lie awake at night listening to their babies breathe.  Most worry: what if she stops?  Then when baby gets her first cold, mom worries that her worst fear is about to come true.  Mucus in the baby’s nose runs to the back of her throat as she lies flat in bed.  The baby gags, then coughs, then splutters, then gives a single sharp cry, gags and coughs and splutters again. By this time mom is on her feet and baby in her arms in one panic-driven motion.  Baby continues to gag.  Mom’ mind races between suctioning baby’s mouth with the bulb syringe, giving back blows, or giving mouth-to-mouth breaths.  Maybe she calls the ambulance, sometimes calls a nurse or paramedic friend who lives nearby.  Eventually mom and baby end up at the triage window and baby is back to normal. What mom has witnessed is a normal event in many little babies’ lives.  Despite mom’s fears, the episode is not life-threatening.  It is not the beginning of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also called “crib death.”  Baby will not choke to death on mucus or vomit lying on her back in the middle of the night.  The coughing and gagging and spluttering and vigorous swallowing baby does are the normal reflexes babies use to clear her airway. The fear that baby will choke to death is made worse by the stories of so many rock-and-roll stars dying of lying on their backs and vomiting.   The problem with theses music icons is that their normal cough and gag reflexes have been numbed by drugs and alcohol so that they can not cough and gag and clear their airways like babies do.  Thus they drown on the little pool of vomit in their throats. Thus the recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics holds true- but babies to sleep on their backs.  SIDS happens twice as often to babies put to sleep on their stomachs because they are more likely to smother in thick bedclothes. So what should mom’s do to make babies with colds sleep better?  One thing to try is to put baby to sleep in a car seat, swing, or bouncer.  When baby is upright, the mucus does not hit the back of the throat and cause coughing and gagging.  Strap baby in!  Do not put baby on a pillow, which greatly increases the risk of SIDS. A second thing to try is a vaporizer at the bedside- indoor air at night is dry, and it dries out mucus so that it is thicker and harder to clear, and airways get more dry and irritated.  A vaporizer putting out mist may moisten baby’s throat and thin the mucus.  Finally, it is okay to give baby tylenol for pain before bedtime- baby may have some sore throat and other pain from the virus that she cannot tell us about. Next time your baby gets a cold, don’t panic.  Try the car seat for bed, try the vaporizer, try tylenol.  And if baby gags in bed, sure, go ahead and call your doctor or your medical neighbor.  But if baby recovers on her own in a few minutes, take a deep breath yourself- baby is okay!

Weird, I thought, what else is in there?  Peeling back a little more, a lizard ran out. A little more, another beetle.  Tired of that game, I yanked the sheet all the way back and there was a scorpion. Hairs standing on end, I thought, “what if I had climbed in without looking?”  After 5 minutes I worked up the courage to flick the bottom sheet to toss the beast on the floor, where I kept stomping and jumping back, I’m sure yelping too, until it was dead.  Then for the only time in my life, I said, “I need a drink,” and sought a bar. While we do have the rare scorpion in Louisiana, far more worrisome arachnids are ticks. Ticks encounters are more common in the fall, when they are most active and their human targets are back outside in cooler weather.  Ticks don’t sting like scorpions, but they can transmit some nasty infections.  The two deadliest are Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and it’s cousin, Erlichiosis.  After a bite, the victim develops fever, headache, and fatigue. Days later a rash of tiny spots appears all over, and the patient gets deathly ill.  Another tick-borne infection is Lyme disease.  This starts with a rash that looks like a target- central redness surrounded by a pale ring, in turn surrounded by a red ring.  If undiagnosed, Lyme can later cause joint pain and swelling and heart and nerve damage. Fortunately, all these infections are more rare in Louisiana than other states.  Lyme is found more north, and despite it’s name Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is mostly in the mid-atlantic states.  However, you can get them, so avoid tick bites.  If hiking in the woods, use bug spray on your socks and pants, and tuck your pants into your socks (ticks climb upward).  When showering later, inspect yourself for ticks- they can be tiny and sneaky.  If you pull them off within 24 hours, you greatly decrease your chance of disease. Enough about scorpions and ticks; we need to talk about the most common arachnid we encounter- spiders.  Spiders have an undeserved reputation as bad guys. But only once in 24 years of practice have I seen a bite from the worst of American spiders- the Black Widow. The 15 year-old farm boy had left his boots in the barn.  That morning when he put them on, without socks, he felt a pinprick between two toes. Thinking nothing of it, he went to work.  That afternoon he began to feel lousy- sweaty, crampy, and weak.  He came into the Emergency Department pale, damp, and breathing hard.  After hearing his story, it was pretty clear what happened.  We admitted him to the Intensive Care Unit for fluids, muscle relaxers, and pain medication, and he eventually recovered. The other “bad” spider in our area is the Brown Recluse. This spider’s bite is also rare. When bitten, the victim usually feels nothing.  However, over the next few days the bite site can get red, swell, and develop a bluish blister of dying tissue.  It looks like an abscess (or “boil”), but with blue-black tones and an open wound where the skin has died. Because of what the Brown Recluse bite looks like, many assume every boil is a spider bite.  Day after day kids and adults come to the Emergency Department complaining of a “spider bite,” when the vast majority of these are due to other skin traumas like cuts and scratches and mosquito bites, that become infected. Though unusual, you don’t want a spider bite in the first place, so it’s best to avoid putting your hands and feet where spiders live.  Both Brown Recluses and Black Widows like dark areas, only biting when their hiding spots are invaded.  So wear heavy gloves when putting your hands in wood piles or other dark spaces.  Keep household and outdoor storage uncluttered- spiders love to hide in old yard debris piles and stacks of bricks. And keep your boots indoors!

LGH has emergency rooms across Acadia, Lafayette, St. Martin and Vermilion parishes - Abrom Kaplan Memorial Hospital , Acadia General Hospital , Lafayette General Medical Center , Lafayette General Southwest , St. Martin Hospital and University Hospital & Clinics . These emergency departments are staffed and open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For non-life threatening injuries, potentially less expensive and quicker service may be available at one of our Urgent Care Center locations .  Sometimes it's hard to know if you should seek emergency care, urgent care or schedule an appointment with your provider. View our guide to emergency care. The emergency departments of LGH offer a shared-emergency program so that a patient arriving at any of its emergency departments can be transferred to the ED at Lafayette General Medical Center (LGMC), the flagship of LGH, or to any other hospital upon request. LGMC handles the highest level of trauma in the Acadiana region. LGMC staffs essential physician specialists providing comprehensive care around the clock. It also means that LGMC offers care throughout the continuum of a patient's illness and injury. The hospital boasts a large adult intensive care unit (ICU) staffed 24/7 by intensivists (physicians specializing in critical care).   In addition, LGMC offers a Dedicated Pediatric Treatment Area within the Emergency Department. The Pediatric Treatment Area is open every day from 11a.m. - 11p.m. and is staffed by pediatricians. The urgency of your condition is determined by an ER triage nurse, which is designed to get the sickest and most seriously injured patients in front of a doctor first. Those facing immediate life-threatening conditions are prioritized and more critical patients are seen first, regardless of their arrival time. To adequately disperse ER resources to the sickest/most injured, sometimes less urgent cases will wait a significant amount of time due to more urgent cases continuously arriving.  Often times, patients with less urgent cases will see a physician assistant or nurse practitioner – this help’s the patient receive quicker medical treatment. Many conditions discovered in the ER require more monitoring and care.  Please take all of the medication prescribed to you and follow up with your primary care physician.  If you don’t have a doctor or are concerned about your ability to afford follow-up care and medications, University Hospital & Clinics has programs that can help. As of Oct. 1, 2015, the Emergency Department providers (doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants with Schumacher Clinical Partners) that work at Lafayette General Medical Center, Lafayette General Southwest, University Hospital & Clinics, St. Martin Hospital, Acadia General Hospital and Abrom Kaplan Memorial are now in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana. Non-critical Emergencies With the exception of Abrom Kaplan, all LGH emergency departments offer a Fast Track program for patients who do not have critical emergencies or have minor ailments or injuries only. Fast Track allows non-critical patients to be seen and released more quickly than waiting for an emergency room physician to become available. This not only helps reduce emergency room backlogs, it reduces wait times for non-critical patients that might get stuck behind more critical cases in the Emergency Room. Non-critical illnesses or injuries should also visit LGH's urgent care clinics: Urgent Care Center at River Ranch in Lafayette Urgent Care Center at Sugar Mill Pond in Youngsville Urgent Care Center at Carencro Main Facilities Lafayette General Medical Center Lafayette General Surgical Hospital Lafayette General Southwest University Hospital & Clinics St. Martin Hospital Acadia General Hospital Abrom Kaplan Memorial Hospital Professional Centers Cancer Center of Acadiana Cyberknife Center of Louisiana Lafayette Behavioral Health Unit Lafayette General Endoscopy Center Lafayette General Imaging Lafayette General Telemedicine Clinics Oil Center Surgical Plaza Urgent Care Centers Services Bariatric Surgery & Medical Weight Loss Cancer Cardiovascular Ear, Nose, and Throat Emergency Medicine Hyperbarics and Wound Care Neuroscience Ophthalmology Plastics and Reconstructive Surgery Orthopedics Pediatrics Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Primary Care Pulmonology Radiology & Imaging Stroke Center Surgery Urology Wellness Women's Health (OB/GYN) Wound Care Lab & Radiology Report Login for Physicians ICD-10-CM-PCS Code Lookup © 2017 Lafayette General Health Site Map | Privacy Policy Healthcare Website design by In10sity (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){

Posted on November 2, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply Being a new mom is hard.  Most moms will tell you that the first months of baby’s new life were a blur of fatigue and misery.  You are tired from child birth and then from waking up every three hours to feed baby.  You are depressed from what pregnancy has done to your body, and new baby does not give back much love.  All baby seems to do is cry, eat, sleep, and make dirty diapers.  And then, if this is your first baby, babies do odd things that scare you.  They get rashes on their faces, they hiccup, and your instinct is to think “What’s wrong?  Is this the beginning of a horrible illness?” We see a lot of new born babies in the Emergency Department for a lot of new mom worries.  The vast majority of these things are normal and safe.  Most moms call or see their doctors to get reassurance, or read a book on raising babies.  Some moms don’t think to call their doctor though, or don’t have a doctor yet after they leave the hospital.  Then when the sun goes down, the baby does something that really scares them, and they come in. Parental worries about newborns come in two groups- breathing and feeding.  The breathing worry is basically: Is my baby going to stop breathing?  Moms lay awake at night and hear their babies make a snoring-like sound.  Babies do this because they have to breathe through their nose, and any dried up mucus up there makes for noisy breathing.  But moms worry- is that going to block baby’s airway?  Worse for mom is when babies have a runny nose and gag and choke on mucus.  Then they are really afraid!  Finally, many babies have irregular breathing, what we call “periodic breathing.”  They will sometimes pause for a few seconds between breaths.  Though all of these things are normal and safe, moms worry that this is the beginning of crib death, or SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). The other big category of mom worries is spitting up and pooping.  When babies spit up, moms are concerned that baby will choke to death on the vomit.  This is a particular worry these days when we tell moms to lay babies down on their backs.  Moms also worry that babies who spit all the time won’t gain weight, and will waste away.  Finally, some newborns will go three or four days without pooping, and moms worry that that is bad.  Again, all these things are normal.  Babies spit up, but are designed to cough and gag and swallow, and thus clear their airway when they are on their backs.  Newborns may spit up a lot, but they hold down enough calories to grow and thrive.  And babies can normally go three or four days without pooping, and this is normal as long as when they do poop, it comes out soft.  Babies don’t explode or get blocked by skipping days pooping. The only things that really worry us about newborns is fever, and sleeping in bed with mom.  In this blog I talk a lot about not worrying about fevers in children.  The only exception to this is fevers in newborns.  Any temperature above 100.4 in a newborn needs to be checked out by a doctor right away.  Sometimes this could mean a more serious infection.  Even more worrisome is moms who worry about their babies so much that they bring baby into their beds.  They think that they can watch baby more closely, but this is the exact WRONG thing to do. It turns out that crib death, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is caused by baby smothering.  In adult beds, they smother in thick bed clothes, soft mattresses and pillows, or under heavily sleeping adults.  Also, no one should ever sleep on a couch with baby either, for the same reasons.  Baby is actually safer sleeping in their own crib, face up, with no thick blankets or pillows or stuffed animals. So before you leave the hospital with your new baby, be sure to have a doctor to call and visit about your worries.  Read a book about new babies- the hospitals often have these to give out.  This way you can save the Emergency Department for emergencies, and not spitty babies.

Posted on June 30, 2017 by klfydoctor This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Claire Ronkartz, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It’s a classic medical board question: “A two-year old visiting her grandparents’ is found with some blood pressure pills.  What is the best first step managing this patient?” Though I’ve answered this questions many times on tests, I was still at a loss when it really happened!  My two year-old had discovered some luggage with unsecured medication inside, and was mouthing one when we came upon her. So I called Poison Control (stop reading now and write down this number: 1-800-222-1222). They advised a trip to the Emergency Department, where our girl drank an activated charcoal mix, was watched for some hours, and we went home. Although we thought we had meticulously placed all medications out of reach, in locked containers, accidents still happen.  So when your child begins crawling (or even after!), it’s a good time to think about child-proofing.  From button batteries to cosmetics and talcum powder, a young adult’s first “grown-up” house, when they have kids, can be a house-of-horrors for youngsters.  The newest hazard is laundry-detergent pods. Designed for ease of use by adults, these tasty-looking, colorful gems can burn mouths and throats and eyes, causing vomiting and breathing difficulty. Do they have to make them look so good to eat? The best way to toddler-proof your house is to be a toddler.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl through every square-inch of your house.  Open every cabinet and drawer you can reach, and put every single thing you find in your mouth.  If you don’t dare eat what you grab, it needs to be somewhere safer.  Then from your hands and knees, look up. What’s above you that looks attractive, or even just mildly fun to play with? Find something to climb on- a kitchen step-stool, chair, or ottoman.  Can you push it over and crawl up within reach of what you see?  Grab the boiling pot.  Eat the medication sitting on the counter.  Absurd as this sounds, if it can be done, a toddler has already done so in the past, and will in the future.  Make sure it’s not your’s. Now that you’ve done a decent job of making home safe for your little one, you may feel adventurous and head out for vacation, or maybe just Wal-Mart.  One such trip to the store nearly ended in tragedy for me.  My child launched herself out of the shopping cart in the one second it took to reach for some salad dressing.  Luckily my husband was right there and grabbed her as she tumbled out head-first!  From then on she was seated and belted in the cart. While that’s not as fun as shopping cart surfing, it may save a trip to the the ER. Going out with toddlers poses a new set of risks than your home.  Perhaps most important when you are out is safety around cars, moving or parked. Every week in the U.S., at least 50 children are backed over in driveways and parking lots. LIttle ones who dart outside to say goodbye often go unseen by a driver when the vehicle is set in motion. Many times the driver is a parent, relative, or neighbor. Following a few simple tips can protect your family from this tragedy.  Teach children that parked cars may move at any time.  Let them know that even if they see the vehicle, the driver may not see them.  Always hold a child’s hand in the parking lot. Teach them never to play in, around, or especially behind any vehicle.  Be especially vigilant when someone else is leaving the house and driving away.  Outside house doors should be toddler-proofed. The world of baby safety can be overwhelming.  And now manufacturers prey on your fears, offering lots of products- toilet bowl locks, outlet plugs, stove knob covers, baby gates, etc.  While some of these items may be helpful, doing the simple things we’ve discussed above goes a long way.  The last thing to do is be prepared for an emergency: post or put in your phone the Poison Control number (again, 1-800-222-1222).  Take a CPR/Heimlich class.  Read the books.  Know the location of your nearest child-capable ER.  And for goodness sake don’t buy those stupid detergent pods.

Posted on February 4, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Brian Allen and Chris Fontenot, Family Practice residents at University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Winter- the season of holidays, travel, and people congregating indoors. Friends and family share hugs, gifts, food, and germs.  Just as common as sharing good tidings and Mardi Gras are those three letters that strike fear into parents: RSV. RSV, or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, is the most common cause of a condition called Bronchiolitis.  Bronchiolitis is an illness in babies and toddlers where the smallest airways in the lungs get inflamed, decreasing oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Worsening inflammation causes a “whistling” sound as the air squeaks through those narrowed airways, a.k.a. wheezing. Anyone can get RSV.  For people over age 2 and adults, it’s simply a cold.  Only babies under age 2 get bronchiolitis.  Even then, if your kid has RSV, don’t panic. Most babies have only a cold as well. RSV is rampant from November through April, particularly in January and February.  Also know that kids don’t stay immune to RSV: some unlucky babies get it twice in a season! The basic symptoms of RSV are runny nose and congestion, cough, fever, and decreased appetite.  Babies with colds can have trouble feeding, because clogged noses make it hard to suck the bottle or breast, and breath. More concerning signs of RSV, when we call it bronchiolitis, are rapid breathing (breathing 60-80 times per minute), wheezing, and worsening feeding.  Kids may have “retractions,” where the skin over the ribcage sucks in as they tug in breaths. Infants may grunt with every breath. Children with grunting, retractions, fast breathing, or worsening drinking need attention immediately. RSV is highly contagious.  It travels on water droplets that are coughed, sneezed, or breathed out.  The virus lasts up to two hours after landing on surfaces like furniture and counters, where others can unknowingly touch, pick it up, and infect themselves. “Your child tested positive for RSV” is a painful phrase for parents.  Parents ask, “Are you sure,” and “Will she have to stay in the hospital?”  T he answer to “Are you sure”, weirdly, doesn’t matter!  As we alluded above, RSV isn’t the only virus to cause bronchiolitis, that condition with coughing, fever, wheezing, and  congestion- many others cause it too.  We don’t recommend testing most kids for RSV, since whether the test is positive or negative, what’s important is how your child is handling bronchiolitis, not which virus caused it. The mainstay of treatment is “supportive care.”  The first support is hydration.  It’s important that children drink plenty, to keep mucus moist, thin, and easy to handle. When an infant or toddler can’t drink because of congestion, they begin to dehydrate.  Their mucus gets dried and sticky and gums up their already inflamed airways. Breast milk or formula are best, but extra clear fluids can help.  Pedialyte is a good option for infants; its designed to hydrate babies if they can’t handle milk.  Babies tend to vomit with bronchiolitis when they gag on mucus and have upset stomachs from swallowing it, and Pedialyte is easier to absorb than milk. However, Pedialyte tastes a little too salty for older children, so these kids can hydrate with dilute juices and sports drinks.  If a kid just won’t drink, he may need admission for IV fluids. Breathing also needs support.  Bedside humidifiers and nasal saline may help hydrate and thin mucus.  Elevating the head helps noses and upper airways stay clear too. When babies starts to struggle to breathe like we discussed above, need oxygen and other respiratory support, it’s time for admission.  Unfortunately, nebulizer breathing treatments don’t help.  Breathing treatments are often prescribed with bronchiolitis since the symptoms look like asthma, which treatments do help.  However, multiple studies have shown that nebulizers for bronchiolitis are a waste of time and money. Finally, keeping your child isolated is important for others to not get RSV- it’s highly contagious, and the cough and “viral shedding” last for weeks.  No daycare until baby is fever free and coughing much less. So don’t panic if your child has RSV. Like we said above, most kids will just have a nasty cold, only a few need hospitalization.  Fever medicine, fluids, patience, and TLC usually take care of it. Posted in Colds in Babies , RSV/Bronchiolitis | Leave a reply What the heck is Bronchiolitis?  Is that like Bronchitis? Posted on January 9, 2013 by klfydoctor 2 No one ever accused modern medicine of being good at naming things.  There are so many jokes out there that whole web sites are devoted to making fun of medical terminology (Example: Definition of Barium: What doctors do after their patients die).  Even Boudreaux and Thibideaux are in on the joke (Doctor: Boudreaux, you’re not sick, you’re just lazy.  Boudreaux: Doc, I coulda tol’ you dat.  But ah need you to give it a big medical name that I can go home and tell Marie!). It really gets confusing when we name important and common things alike.  Bronchiolitis is a very common and serious illness in infants, and we see it a lot in the winter.  This winter has been particularly busy.  Bronchiolitis starts out as a regular cold, with cough and runny nose.  Then the baby starts having fevers and wheezing and trouble breathing that looks and sounds like asthma.  Sometimes babies have to be in the hospital for oxygen and IV fluids, because they are too busy breathing hard to be able to drink their milk. Bronchiolitis IS NOT bronchitis.  When adult doctors use the term bronchitis, they are talking about an infection in the airways that is often treated with antibiotics.  Kids don’t get bronchitis- rarely do they need an antibiotic for coughs and colds.  Bronchiolitis is caused by viruses, and antibiotics don’t cure those.  One of the more common viruses to cause bronchiolitis is the RSV virus, and often doctors and families use RSV and Bronchiolitis to mean the same thing.  However, many viruses can cause bronchiolitis, not just RSV. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of things that make bronchiolitis better.  As above, antibiotics are useless.  The breathing treatments we use for asthmatics do not help most babies with bronchiolitis.  Steroids don’t help either.  Doctors sometimes prescribe treatments or steroids for lack of anything better to do.  The only thing really that can be done is “supportive care”.  This means fluids and oxygen and monitoring in the hospital when needed. How do you keep your baby from getting bronchiolitis?  As usual, keep them clean.  Wash your hands to make sure your cold virus does not get on baby and baby’s stuff.  Visitors and family need to wash their hands too before picking up baby.  People with colds need to keep their distance.  Day Care and Mother’s Day Out workers need to be extra careful about this. So when you hear your baby’s doctor talk about bronchiolitis , listen up.  If the doctor talks about bronchitis, they must be making a joke.  Paging Dr. Boudreaux. Posted in RSV/Bronchiolitis | 2 Replies ‘Tis The Season For RSV Wheezin’ Posted on November 2, 2009 by klfydoctor 2 We can tell by the paramedic’s voice on the radio if a child is truly sick.  This time his voice has that urgency that says “be ready.” Moments later they come trundling in, oxygen cylinders hissing, monitors beeping, and the little baby in the big stretcher struggling to breathe, chest heaving.  Into the trauma room, baby is lifted onto the ED bed, trailing monitor wires.  Nurses and techs move in, changing oxygen tubes, starting IVs, hooking up monitors, putting on stethoscopes. After a brief talk with the parents and a quick exam of the baby, I see that the baby has Bronchiolitis.  The breathing treatments we give have little effect- baby still struggles to breathe.  Baby is admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for IV fluids, oxygen, and monitoring.  She will get better eventually, but it will take time and care. Bronchiolitis is a common winter ailment for infants and toddlers.  Many people recognize this ailment when it is called RSV, but the RSV virus is only one of the many viruses that can cause it.  Bronchiolitis starts as a cold, with runny nose and cough.  In some little kids it progresses to fever, wheezing (a whistling sound from low in the lungs), and trouble breathing. Bronchiolitis is one of those frustrating illnesses where modern medicine offers little to stop its progression or ease its distress.  Plenty of fluids help, maybe a vaporizer at the bedside, and Tylenol for fever and comfort.  Sometimes nebulizer treatments help, but like in our case above often they don’t. The good news is that most babies with Bronchiolitis just have a bad cold.  The treatment for that is described in the “Colds in Babies” category, which you can access from the Categories column on the right side of this page.  A few babies wheeze like an asthmatic and need more attention.  Very few babies need to be in the PICU and it is rare for one to die. So if your baby has a cough and runny nose but is breathing and drinking comfortably, all is well.  Start the vaporizer and Tylenol, maybe have your baby sleep sitting up in a car seat or swing  (no propping on pillows!).  If you think baby is wheezing or tugging for breath, or is having trouble sucking a bottle for its work of breathing, come right in and see us.

Posted on August 14, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply With the recent Grand theater shooting, I realized I hadn’t written about gun safety, so it’s overdue.  But I don’t like talking about gun tragedies since I spent a week on the trauma team in third year of medical school.  That week we had three incidents of children coming into the trauma room, dying of gunshot wounds.  The third child was the 5 year-old son of a DEA agent, who had come home from an overnight stake out.  Exhausted, he tossed his pistol on the kitchen table and crashed in bed.  The son woke up sometime later, and you can guess the rest. I don’t like talking about guns and kids, but as my priest said this past Sunday, a real conversation on guns is overdue. Pediatric firearms deaths aren’t a single event like at the Grand either, but an ongoing problem.  Twice as many children and teens die from gunshots as die from cancer. Preventing firearm tragedies begins at home, where most deaths occur.  In the past I have discussed how to best prevent your child from drowning in a pool- don’t have one.  Same with guns- it’s best just not to have one in the house.  I own a shotgun, but while my kids were growing up I kept it at my father-in-law’s. If you must have a gun in the house (we’ll discuss the statistics of that further on), keep it locked in a gun safe, unloaded, with the ammunition locked separately. Regardless of your position on the National Rifle Association (NRA), they advocate this. The NRA has another good idea about safety- teach your kids about guns, to take away the mystery. Teach them to not touch, and even run away from, unattended guns (like at a friend’s house) and immediately tell an adult about unsecure guns. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises doctors to discuss gun safety at office visits, just like above.  Except in Florida, where the legislature and governor passed a law forbidding pediatricians from doing just that.  You would think that that’s unconstitutional, given the right to free speech and a doctor’s duty to ensure child safety. Discussing gun safety is akin to discussing safely storing ant poison.  Inexplicably, two courts have ruled in favor of the law, which illustrates how far afield the gun debate has gone. Fortunately we’re in Louisiana, so talking gun safety is okay.  As we discussed, it’s best not to have a gun in the house at all.  When my kids were little I kept my shotgun at my father-in-law’s.  When my son became curious about guns, his uncles and I took him hunting to teach him firearm safety.  Our favorite memory is of Uncle Tommy taking him on a squirrel hunt.  They rode the four-wheeler through the woods, zigzagging in the brush for so long that my son thought he was clear to Bunkie, though they ended up only 100 yards from the house.  My son never even touched the rifle, but he learned all about it. If you have a gun in the house, keep it locked in a gun safe, unloaded, with the ammunition locked away separately.   But keeping it locked doesn’t make sense, some will say. What if someone breaks into my house- the gun won’t be ready!  The statistics are clear: violent home invasions are rare, and guns in the house are much more likely to kill the owner or a family member than an intruder.  Accidental deaths and suicides from home firearms are far more common than successful home defenses.  It’s better to get a dog with a deep, loud bark. Finally, as any responsible gun owner will say, you must know the laws of ownership and use.  Particularly, as Seth Fontenot unfortunately found out, it’s illegal to use a firearm to stop a robbery.  One of my nurses who is an ex-marine and hunter puts it this way: if someone goes into your garage and starts walking away with your stuff right in front of you, you can’t use a gun to stop them.  You can call 911, and start taking stuff out of his car and putting it back in your garage, but no guns! Again, better to have a big loud dog.

What is a vampire facial? The vampire facial is a technique performed in the office of Ryan Chastant, M.D. , using micro-needling pen called “Rejuvapen” with nine micro-needles to create controlled micro-injuries to the skin while topically applying platelet rich plasma (PRP). What is Micro-Needling? The micro-needling technique starts the skin’s natural repair process, producing collagen and elastin.  The micro-channels created with the micro-needling technique allows for optimal absorption of PRP enhancing its effect in the deepest layers of your skin for optimum wound healing. What is platelet rich plasma (PRP)? PRP is a concentration of platelets in your blood, which are crucial to wound healing.  It releases growth factors into the skin to accelerate your body’s repair process. “Using your own body’s ability to heal itself is where the magic in the whole procedure is,” says Dr. Chastant. Who benefits from a vampire facial? The vampire facial is ideal for smoothing fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, traumatic scars and stretch marks.  It also makes your skin smoother, brightens your skin tone and makes your skin all around clearer. What does it feel like? When you hear the word micro-needles you instantly think “Ouch!”  However, the vampire facial starts out like any other facial. First, there is a cleansing and toning treatment.  Then the aesthetician massages your face with a topical numbing ointment. Once the ointment has set in, the micro-needling procedure begins.  While the microneedling-pen makes a buzzing noise, it feels similar to using a skin cleansing brush.  It is a steady massage across your skin. How long does the procedure last? From the time you enter the office to the time you leave is approximately 90 minutes. What can I expect after the procedure? Directly after the procedure your skin will have a red and flushed look, similar to a minor sunburn.   The red color lasts approximately 24 hours.  Most patients will also experience a minor burning sensation, similar to how you would feel with a minor sunburn. Dr. Chastant provides you with skin soothing masks and products that will leave your skin glowing.   In less than a week later, your skin feels smoother and has an enhanced glow. When will I see the results? It is recommended you have three to four treatments to receive optimum results.   Please consult with Dr. Chastant and his team regarding your unique treatment plan.

Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog!

Posted on October 5, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 Some people just don’t know what to say to babies and toddlers.  I remember a moment from a TV show, where a young and hip man was left alone with a little kid, and was plainly   uncomfortable.  Desperately fishing for something to break the silence, he finally says “So, you’re a kid, huh?” Not the smoothest conversation starter, but when it comes to talking to new babies, really pretty much anything will do.  Newborn babies are sponges for hearing and learning, and the more words and talk they hear, the more they learn, and the smarter they become.  There are a few easy hints to make talking to babies better for them.  First, talk to them with your face about a foot or two in front of theirs.  Newborns like looking at faces, but their new eyes can only focus on faces that close.  Second, make the most of the time that baby is awake.  Newborns are only awake about four hours per day, so that is the time to lay it on.  Just start talking, use lots of different words, use an upbeat voice.  For the first month you may not get much response, but don’t be discouraged.  After that time babies “wake up” to the world, and nothing is more fun than watching their faces light up when you start talking.  They start cooing along and smiling and laughing, and that is the best. When you talk to toddlers, stay upbeat and positive, and keep talking with a lot of different words.  Believe it or not, toddlers still don’t speak much English at 1 to 3 years old.  They still only have a few words they really understand, like “no,” “juice,” and “cat.”  Use full sentences even if they can’t; they’ll learn.  Even if the toddler acts defiant, stay polite and upbeat.  They learn good English and good manners by imitation, so be a good role model. When toddlers begin to act bad, this is when talking positive and being polite become hard work.  Yelling at them to “Sit down!” and “Shut up!” teaches them to speak rudely too.  Also, they don’t understand the meaning of lots of commands and sentences, so they can only follow the tone of your voice and body language.  Modeling impatience and frustration teaches them to be impatient and easily frustrated. Therefore, talking to toddlers needs to be done in a way that you want your toddler to act and talk.  ”Please sit down so mommy can do this” should be done in a polite tone, with gently guiding the toddler to his chair.  If he is acting badly and defiant and just won’t sit down, then gently guide him to his time-out chair, the one with the buckle that keeps him in place.  The time-out should last as many minutes as his age- one year olds stay in for one minute, two year-olds for two minutes, and so on.  And then ignore all screams and rants and bad behavior and go about your business in a calm way.  When time is up, ask “Are you ready to be helpful?,” again in a positive voice.  If he is, great.  If not and the defiance continues, back into the chair for another break. I am not saying that this approach with toddlers is easy or always possible, except for the most saintly and patient of parents.  However, you need to start making the effort and keep reminding yourself to stay nice.  Many toddlers are hard work when it comes to making good behavior, but the effort counts! When it comes to talking to babies and toddlers, just start.  To quote a movie title, Say Anything.  Say it nicely, and say it a lot.

After school your son goes outside to play.  Later he comes in dirty and sweaty, and then pulls the crumpled letter from his backpack. It’s on school letterhead, formal intro……LICE???  They found lice in your son’s hair!  Your head spins: Where did he get them? Does he have to miss school?  Do my other kids have them?  DO I HAVE THEM? You unconsciously begin scratching your head. Head lice is not uncommon in school children.  Lice are critters that live on the scalp, biting and taking blood for nourishment.  They can’t jump like fleas or fly like mosquitoes, they simply walk around.  Their bites don’t spread infections but they do itch, often the only symptom. Since lice only walk, they pass from person to person soley by direct contact. For this reason, taking selfies with others has been recognized as a new mode of transmission. Your son likely got lice from a schoolmate, or someone else in your house. But simply being in the same classroom is safe: kids diagnosed with lice should finish the school day, avoiding head contact with others, and start treatment that evening. Treatment is straight-forward.  First, check everyone in the house, and yourself! Everyone must be treated simultaneously so they don’t re-infect each other after treatment. The best treatments are over-the-counter products like Permethrin 1% lotion.  Follow the directions on the box carefully. Sometimes it takes two or more treatments.  If you’ve heard that lice in your area are resistant, call your doctor about alternatives. After treatment, comb out the lice and eggs with a fine-toothed comb.  Re-comb daily. Clothes and bedding should be washed in hot water and dried in high heat.  If a favorite stuffed animal or pillow can’t be washed, putting them in sealed plastic bag for 2 weeks will starve lice or eggs.  Kids with super-thick piles of curly hair will be easier to treat after a shorter haircut. The CDC and American Academy of Dermatology websites have great articles on lice eradication. Their instructions are simple, and tell you what not to go crazy over.  So you can be rid of lice and move on! Everyone in Louisiana knows mosquitoes.  Many also have run-ins with fleas or scabies, not to mention the lice we talked about above.  All these critters attack your skin, bite, and cause itchies. Treat with anti-itch cream and maybe some Benadryl, in case of fleas treat your pets too, and you’re done.  Then, there’s bedbugs. Bedbugs are tougher.  They are bugs like lice, that crawl on your skin and bite to suck blood.  They look like walking apple seeds.  However, bedbugs only bite when you’re sleeping and then go hide, so you never see them.  All you know is that you’re getting itchy bumps, and assume it’s mosquitoes. If you’re getting more itchy bumps at night, and are pretty sure there aren’t swarms of mosquitoes in your house, you may have bedbugs.  Time to look: they hide in crevices in mattresses or other furniture.  If you find them, call a pest management professional, because unlike lice they’re hard to eradicate. The good news is that preventing bedbugs isn’t hard.  They’re most often picked up when you travel, staying in hotels or other’s homes.  If you’re not careful they’ll hitch a ride home in your suitcase, or if you buy used furniture that you haven’t inspected carefully. Here’s how to prevent un-wanted fellow travelers.  If you start getting itchy bumps while staying elsewhere, unmake the bed and inspect the mattress seams.  If you find them or their dirt, move out!  Keep your suitcase on a luggage rack: bedbugs aren’t jumpers and can’t crawl up the smooth legs of the rack.  If you put your clothes in hotel drawers, inspect them first.  Put dirty clothes in a sealed plastic bag.  If you buy used furniture, check it carefully. If bedbugs get in your house, they’re expensive and difficult to eliminate.  But the good news is that though they’re gross and itchy, like lice they don’t carry diseases.  But it’s another case where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, like the cost of a new mattress and the exterminator. So take care when traveling; you don’t want unwanted hitchhikers!

Elizabeth Hunter and Alex Wolf, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. “Oh no, another one?” exclaimed mom as she inspected Jamie, her one year-old’s, diaper.  It was full to the brim and smelled horrendous, and this was the third since noon! It was 5:30 pm, the doctor’s office already closed. “What do I do now?” This had never happened before.  Jamie was never sick. Mom looked up ”child with diarrhea” on the internet, tried to read the articles, but felt overwhelmed. However, Jamie, giggling and toddling around with her sippy cup, seemed to be taking it well. Mom wondered: What caused this?  Is she dehydrated?  Should I take her to the ER? It’s a common parent scenario- your child’s pants explode and you begin to worry. Fortunately, most kids with diarrhea do well at home.  Step one, evaluate your child.  Is he playful, or at least awake and active?  Is he drinking? Is the inside of his mouth moist? If so, there’s little danger of dehydrating. If however, she becomes progressively more sluggish through the day, starts vomiting, or begins to drink less and less, it’s time to call your doctor.  While making urine is the best sign that baby isn’t dehydrated, sometimes there’s so much watery diarrhea in the diaper that you can’t tell if there’s pee or not.  You have to go by those other signs. Most diarrhea is caused by viruses caught from other kids, though too much fruit juice, antibiotics, or other infections can cause it too. T reating diarrhea is easy- keep the fluids coming, and food too.  If food and liquids look like their just running through baby and out the back end, keep it coming.  She will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by.  The slogan these days is “feed through” diarrhea.  Starchy foods are best- bananas, rice, toast.  Stay away from high sugar drinks like soda or fruit juice- these make for more acidy diarrhea, which makes diaper rashes worse. You’re awakened in the early morning by a new sound: a gurgling from one of the kid’s bedrooms.  You rush in, flip on the light, and are greeted by the sight of a vomit-filled bed. Yuck!  While this is certainly a mess to clean up, more important worries crop up.  Is this just a stomach bug, or something worse? Vomiting is an important protective mechanism, expelling toxins before they have a chance to harm us internally.  However, viruses often cause inappropriate vomiting. Rather than evacuating the virus, the virus uses vomiting to spread throughout the environment.  Like out of your child into her bed, potentially infecting you and your other kids. When do you need the Emergency Department, when can you stay home?  Most kids who only have a few bouts stay hydrated.  What’s too much? Vomiting for more than 12 hours in a baby is worrisome.  For children between one and two years, 24 hours is getting too long; 48 hours for older kids. It’s also concerning when your child stops drinking between bouts and becomes more lethargic- sleeping for longer periods and harder to arouse.  If he hasn’t urinated for more than 12 hours, it’s time to get seen. While vomiting is usually viral and is over in a day, sometimes it’s a sign of worse trouble. If baby vomits dark green, that’s concerning for bowel obstruction, go in right away.  If she’s having bad pain, especially in the lower right side of her belly, that could be appendicitis.  If a baby under six month’s old has projectile vomiting, meaning vomit sailing clear out of the bed, that could be stomach blockage needing surgery. Otherwise, vomiting can be treated at home.  After your child vomits, rest the stomach for an hour before letting him drink.  Then start with only small amounts of clear liquid.  Water is okay for older kids, but babies and toddlers do better with drinks like pedialyte, or low-sugar sports drinks like Gatorade G2.  Half a cup is plenty at first- if you give too much, it may push the stomach to vomit again.  You can switch to larger amounts later when the vomiting has stopped. Don’t worry about food. Few children starve during vomiting.  Your child can go days without eating, so don’t panic when she doesn’t have an appetite- she won’t waste away within a few days! Posted in Diarrhea , Vomiting | Leave a reply When Vacation Follows You Home Posted on July 29, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Michael Johnson and Sam Defigarelli, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. The family returns from a cruise ship holiday in the Caribbean.  Everyone, including 10 year-old Gavin, had a blast.  He loved snorkeling, going down the waterslide on the ship, and even the exotic food at ports-of-call.  But even before the bags are unpacked at home, he says “Uh-Oh!” and runs to the bathroom, just in time for the watery explosion from below. Traveler’s Diarrhea is a condition that develops soon after returning from trips to resource-limited countries.  Gavin has three potential whammies in his scenario.  These countries often don’t have sewage treatment, and snorkeling is a potential contact with contaminated run-off.  Cruise ships and water-parks are known risks for catching diarrhea.  And improperly prepared food could make him sick as well. The biggest concern with diarrhea is dehydration.  Most only have a day or two of loose stools, but some also have nausea, vomiting, cramps, fever, or bloody stools.  When there’s lots of vomiting and diarrhea and worries about dehydration, kids should get seen. Most kids only need home treatment- plenty of clear fluids like pedialyte for infants, sports drinks or dilute juices for older kids.  Avoid full strength fruit juices- these can worsen diarrhea.  For copious diarrhea, rehydration solution packets are available at pharmacies, to mix with clean water.  If kids aren’t having cramps, nausea, or vomiting, they can eat and have milk.  Bland starchy foods are best- fast food and other heavy greasy food can prolong symptoms.  We say ”feed through diarrhea;” don’t restrict food if they’re hungry!  The sooner they eat, the sooner their guts get back in balance. You’ll want to control the spread of infection to you and your family, so that you aren’t cleaning up after multiple kids and feeling rotten yourself- a total nightmare!  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water- better than hand sanitizers.  Make sure kids aren’t touching or drinking after each other. Prevention while traveling is even better.  Only drink from unopened bottles.  Avoid ice- it could be made with contaminated water.  Eat food served hot, and avoid salads (ingredients washed how?).  And parents, alcohol won’t reliably sterilize water or ice, so avoid having your cold one on the rocks. Here is a different scenario than above. It’s June, the annual family reunion picnic, with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins . The grills are going and the sides have been put out: coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni salad.  There is a lot going on: pick-up football, pets running about, tables knocked over, umbrellas and chairs being set up, conversations all around.  The hamburgers are late getting on the grill and the sides have sat in the sun.  Everyone’s hungry so the burgers are a little under-done, but so what? Any dangerous situations in this story?  It’ not the football- it’s the mayonnaise-based sides warming in the sun, incubating bacteria like Staphylococcus.  And undercooked hamburger can contain E. coli, a potentially disastrous infection. Food poisoning is all too common in children.  Usually it’s just some diarrhea for a day or two and maybe some vomiting if your unlucky.  However, food poisoning with certain bacteria can have worse consequences.  Staphylococcus (a.k.a.”Staph”) often has a quick onset, within hours of ingestion, and can lead to dehydration and fatigue, especially in younger children.  There are many strains of E. coli too, the worst of which can lead to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, a deadly disease involving kidney failure and coma. Treatment of these bacteria infections isn’t just giving antibiotics.  In fact, sometimes antibiotics can make the symptoms worse.  There’s no treatment besides fluids and rest, and for the really sick kids, hospitalization.  So better to prevent infections than have them! Safe food handling is paramount.  Always cook meat thoroughly, particularly ground meat.  Be careful of your meat source- meat from a single farm, ground in the store, is much safer than meat from multiple feed lots, pre-ground and packaged when it gets to the store.  Never leave mayonnaise-containing food unrefrigerated for more than one hour.  Be sure to wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly- they might be from fields fertilized with manure that contains E. coli. So be careful when you travel, and when you cook at home.  An ounce of prevention is worth several pounds of diarrhea, when vacation follows you home! +++++++++++ Posted in Diarrhea , Traveling with Children | Leave a reply Running With The Runs Posted on October 11, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Jamie Collins, a Family Practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. It was the start of a great day for Kevin.  It was Saturday and no school and no homework.  However, Kevin’s mom was on a mission to find a new couch for the living room and as a result, Kevin and his brothers were dragged from one furniture store to another.  At their last stop of the day, Kevin felt an uncomfortable stirring in his stomach, followed by watery sounds from below.  His mother told him to get off the couch he was sitting on, but too late. His pants erupted in a gurgling roar. Diarrhea is one of the most common reasons children are brought to the doctor.  Children get diarrhea more often than adults.  Diarrhea is the body’s way of ridding itself of germs, and most episodes last from a few days to a week.  Diarrhea is defined as more stools than usual and more watery than usual.  The usual amount for infants is about 3 to 10 stools per day.  Breast fed infants have more and looser stool than formula-fed infants. Some infants can go 3-4 days without stooling, and that can be normal too.  Toddlers and older children usually go once or twice daily.  So if your breast-fed baby is having six watery stools per day, that’s not diarrhea, that’s normal! The consistency and color of a child’s stool changes with age, and most color changes are normal.  Brown, yellow, green- all normal.  Diet changes can change the consistency.  Too much fruit juice makes for looser stools.  Stools that are all watery or full of mucus- that is not normal.  And white, bloody, or coal-black stools are not normal. The most common cause of diarrhea in kids is infection from a virus, like rotavirus.  Other organisms such as salmonella or giardia, can cause diarrhea too.  Most diarrhea lasts from 3 to 14 days, and often comes with vomiting, stomach ache, headache, and fever. The biggest concern about diarrhea is dehydration, which makes it important to keep your kid drinking.  For infants, keep the breast milk or formula coming.  It was once said that milk makes diarrhea worse.  However, it turns out that the sooner infants and children are on their milk and regular diet, the sooner they get better.  Today’s recommendation is to “feed through” diarrhea.  If it looks like what you are putting in the top is coming out the bottom, keep it coming!  Your child will absorb enough fluids and nutrients to get by. If your baby is too ill to drink milk, then an oral hydration solution such as pedialyte or infalyte will help supply the fluids and electrolytes that are lost from diarrhea.  Older children can drink any clear liquid they like.  Popsicles are a good way to get fluids into a child who has been vomiting and needs to rehydrate slowly. Here are things that make diarrhea worse: Drinking too much sugary fruit juice.  If your child will only drink juice when they are sick, cut the juice with half and half with water.  Antibiotics can also make diarrhea worse.  If your kid is already on an antibiotic and gets diarrhea, call your doctor to discuss whether to continue the medicine or not.  A full appetite is often the last behavior to return after an illness.  Children should be allowed to take their time returning to their normal eating.  Children usually tolerate bland, starchy foods better. Dehydration is the most worrisome complication of diarrhea.  The signs of dehydration include dizziness and light-headedness, a dry sticky mouth, very little or no urine for a 12 to 24 hour period, no tears when crying.  If you think your child is dehydrated, call your doctor. Parents of kids with diarrhea should avoid spreading infection.  Care with frequent hand washing and keeping sick kids out of school or daycare until the diarrhea is controlled are ways to limit the people exposed.  Hand washing is the best way to prevent the spread of diarrhea to others, and yourself!  Hand sanitizer is the next best way for disinfecting hands when a sink is not handy, but does not guard against all types of diarrhea. I hope you’ve enjoyed all this poo-poo talk with your morning paper.  Now go wash those hands!

Posted on November 18, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chad Mathews, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Flu season is here.  If you’ve never had the flu, you’re fortunate.  Dr. Hamilton tells the story of when he had it.  Besides the cough, headache, and body aches, he was under the covers shivering violently from fever despite having taken both ibuprofen and Tylenol.  He was shaking so badly he swore he had something worse than influenza, though tests showed that’s all it was.  Since then Dr. Hamilton gets the shot every year. The “flu” we’re talking about is the Influenza virus.  It affects all ages, little ones too.  It usually attacks the upper airways, causing cough, runny nose, and sore throat.  It can also affect the GI tract, with vomiting and diarrhea.  What’s universal is a whole week of misery, with headache and fever and hit-by-a-truck fatigue.  It’s particularly rough on babies, and children with asthma, who are at risk for complications like pneumonia and dehydration. While most viruses have no treatment and must run their course, influenza is one of the few with a medicine that can help- Tamiflu.  Tamiflu may shorten the time kids are sick, and make them less contagious.  It should be started within 48 hours of onset of illness or it won’t help at all, and it only shaves a few days off the week of misery. Thus the best treatment will always be prevention.  Influenza is highly contagious, easily passed between kids by coughing and sneezing on each other, and touching each other with infected hands; in other words flu is passed when kids “slime” one another.  Kids should therefore be taught to cough and sneeze into their hands or elbow crook, and wash their hands often. The other extremely effective weapon against influenza is vaccination.  To illustrate the vaccine’s effectiveness, a 2014 study showed 74% decreased pediatric intensive care admissions in vaccinated kids; meaning 74% fewer kids got influenza’s life-threatening complications.  And a flu vaccine not only protects the kid who gets it, but all the other kids around him whom he WON’T infect. I know one old Cajun who just won’t get the influenza vaccine.  He agrees it’s a good idea and used to get the vaccine every year.  However, he got sick every year right after the shot.  In fact, it seemed he was getting the flu itself- long lasting cough, fever, aches, fatigue, upset stomach.  “Ain’t goin’ do it,” he exclaims, “had enough gittin’ sick from dat shot!” Like we mentioned above, influenza virus is highly contagious, and highly miserable.  It comes around in wintertime, makes you and your kids feel rotten for a whole week, and spreads easily.  Besides hand washing and avoidance, vaccination is the best way to prevent getting it. Why do you need a shot every year?  Don’t you stay immune?  Unfortunately, every year the influenza virus changes chemically- it evolves to fool your immune system and sneak by.  So every few years scientists have to make predictions about how the virus might change, and tweak the vaccine’s design. Then you need the new shot to cover the new strain. What about that old Cajun who believes he gets the flu from the shot?  I’ve encountered other families who refused the vaccine because of this concern.  However, it’s impossible to get influenza from the vaccine.  This is because the virus in the vaccine is either “inactivated,” meaning it’s ability to reproduce in your body has been removed, or the vaccine is “recombinant,” meaning that only pieces of the virus are in the vaccine. So saying you can get the flu from the vaccine is like saying you are going to drive your car to the store, even though the engine has been removed (“inactivated”), or the only parts of your car available are the steering wheel and a fender (“recombinant”). Either way, you’re not getting to the store. People who seem to get influenza from the vaccine are actually catching the flu (or other illnesses) around the time they’re getting vaccinated, but before the vaccine can “take.”  If you’re in the office waiting for your shot, and the kid next to you already has it and coughs on you, too late!  You’re going to get sick before your immune system has a chance to build immunity to the virus.  Bad luck!

Posted on December 18, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply Dave was the quarterback for my college fraternity’s football team.  Though it was flag football, Dave got knocked down a lot, and several times hit his head on the ground.  For days he would act confused, repeat questions over and over, and finally recover. He graduated to go on to fly Navy jets and finally got a helmet to wear!  Dr. Blake McDonald, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette, discusses concussions this week: pay attention! Concussion is an injury caused by a blow to the head.  This injury impairs neurologic function: concussions interfere with coordination, thinking, emotions, and sleep.  They eventually heal, but it takes time. Concussions aren’t bleeding in the brain or skull fractures- they aren’t detected by CT or MRI scans.  They can be measured by neuropsychological tests, where the patient interacts with a computer program or a paper-and-pencil test.  In other words, concussion is a functional injury, not a structural one. Concussions are a big problem, bigger than statistics report.  About 144,000 people per year visit ERs for concussions, but one review estimates that there may be up to 3.8 million recreation and sports concussions per year in the U.S.  And that doesn’t include injuries in grade school and middle school athletes. Football is the riskiest sport for concussions in high-school boys, soccer and basketball for girls.  Rugby, ice hockey, cheerleading, and lacrosse also probably have high concussion rates, but their data are limited since these are often club activities rather than official school sports. Headache and impaired coordination are the main physical symptoms of concussion. Loss of consciousness is another physical sign, but this only happens in 10% of concussions- you don’t have to be knocked out to have a concussion! Concussions also affect cognitive function- the ability to think and remember. Kids with concussions have trouble with homework, concentration, and thinking clearly.  Memory is also impaired- a concussed child may not remember what happened for some time before and after the injury.  Some kids have short term memory loss, asking the same question over and over. Besides causing physical symptoms and thinking deficits, concussion can affect emotional stability.  Concussed kids are often tearful and depressed.  They can be emotionally “labile,” meaning one minute they are acting silly, the next minute moody. Kids with concussions sleep a lot.  This worries parents who have heard not to let head-injured kids sleep.  But sleeping late and napping with a concussion is part of normal healing. So how can we help concussions heal?  Management involves avoiding activities that slow natural recovery.  This means allowing time for physical, cognitive, and emotional recovery, and not worsening things.  Even the NFL now recognizes that if you send an athlete back out who has impaired coordination, concentration, and thinking, they stand a greater chance of getting more hurt. Cognitive and physical rest are the mainstays of management.  Cognitive rest means staying home from school.  Upon return, concussed kids may need shorter school days and reduced work.  They may need more time for assignments or tests.  If headaches return, the child may need to be out of school longer.  Videogames and computers can worsen symptoms too. To be allowed to return to full school work or sports, the child must be symptom-free- no headaches, normal coordination, no trouble thinking or remembering, no more fatigue or depression.  This can be a problem with motivated athletes who hide their symptoms to stay in the game.  Coaches, teachers, and parents need to be vigilant.  If a kid hits her head and then seems impaired, the approach is simple: “when in doubt, sit them out!” Coaches and trainers should be aware of sideline tests for concussion to detect impairment. When kids do return to school or sports, they need a “graduated” increase in intensity.  This means slowly increasing class work and home work.  In sports, it means slowly increasing physical intensity, then adding complexity (like adding drills and plays), then scrimmaging, then full play.  Worsening symptoms during that time mean “back off!” Though there’s been much prevention talk about mouth guards, better headgear, altered sports rules, the best tools to prevent and treat concussions are education and recognition- for athletes, parents, coaches, trainers, teachers, administrators.  And doctors and nurses too! Posted in Head Injury | Leave a reply Baby Fall, Go Boom! Posted on September 18, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Marc Fernandez, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Bumps, scrapes, and bruises can be found on the scalp of any active child, some so much they look like a scuffed shoe.  Kids explore and lead with their big heads, so it comes with the territory. Usually it’s easy to know when a scalp bump can be cured with a mommy’s kiss.  These are the minor boo-boos from flying soccer balls or cups thrown by grumpy siblings. It’s also not hard to know when a more traumatic blow requires an Emergency Room visit. It’s an easy decision if your child gets knocked out cold by a baseball bat, or is in a high-impact traffic collision. These obvious ones you bring to the hospital. What about those in-between injuries:  the short falls on the head from a tree branch, the heavy tackles at football practice, the head-on sprints into an invisible glass door? Even if toddlers cry for a couple of minutes after a smack to the crown, or teens seem a little confused after a soccer ball to the head, they’re usually soon skipping around like nothing happened. However, every parent has heard stories from someone they know, or about a celebrity, who seemed fine after a head injury, didn’t go the hospital, and then didn’t wake up the next morning.  These tales will make any parent rush the kid in with the teensiest knock on the noggin. Fortunately we now have scientifically valid criteria to evaluate those in-between cases, to decide who needs a brain scan and who doesn’t: -Does your child complain of a really bad headache, or seem confused? -Was he knocked out? -Is she vomiting? -Did he fall from over 5 feet up, or have another high-impact injury to the head (like a thrown baseball)? These are the kids who need to get seen, but these criteria apply to kids 2 years-old and up.  What about the smaller fry? Babies and toddlers fall a lot.  Even before babies can sit up, they will roll.  Off the bed. They tumble out of car seats and strollers.  Then when they first start walking, toddlers look like high-wire artists, weaving about with their arms out for balance, everyone around wondering, will he fall, won’t he?  Then the toddler learns to run, and is not deterred by walls or coffee tables. Like minor head injuries in older kids from above, it’s usually easy to tell which baby or toddler is okay.  She bonks her head on the coffee table, cries for a minute, and then gets up and runs after the cat.  Baby flops out of the car seat that is on the floor, scrapes his forehead, then goes back to wiggling and cooing, and nurses fine. So when do we worry?  Our high-risk criteria for older kids we discussed above don’t seem to apply to the littler ones.  How can you tell if baby has a bad headache, or is “confused?”  And many babies vomit daily, whether they hit their head or not.  For these reasons we have separate rules for head injuries involving kids under 2 years-old: -Does baby have a large bump anywhere on the scalp, except the forehead?  Forehead bumps are allowed, since that is where the skull is hardest, designed for the most common, front-end impacts. -Did the child lose consciousness for more than 5 seconds?  Many toddlers are temporarily dazed after smacking their heads, so we give them 5 seconds to recover their wits. -Is the child acting normally, or is he more sluggish or more fussy? -Did baby fall from more than 3 feet, or have a similarly traumatic blow? Note that vomiting is not on the list for babies and toddlers.  Some toddlers will vomit when they cry really hard, and many babies spit up randomly.  Vomiting doesn’t correlate with bad head injuries in the littler ones- many toddlers who end up in Pediatric Intensive Care don’t vomit, and many babies who are fine vomit all day anyway. So when baby falls and goes boom, you will initially freak out and want to rush to the doctor. Then take a breath, think about the above, and use your own noggin to decide! Posted in Head Injury | Leave a reply “He Bumped His Head And Went To Bed…” Posted on December 19, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Jesse Livingston, a family practice resident at the LSU-University Health Center here in Lafayette. Kids fall and hit their heads a lot.  Though most children with head injuries are fine, some need evaluation in the Emergency Department.  The parent can have difficult decisions to make, while at the same time dealing with a crying baby: Is the brain okay?  Does my child need a CT scan?  Can he nap?  We have all heard the nursery rhyme about the old man who bumped his head, went to bed, and couldn’t get up in the morning.  What about your two-year old, who despite every effort will “fall and go boom?” The decision is easy for the worst falls.  If a child loses consciousness, has a seizure, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, is lethargic or confused, then she needs to be seen.  The doctor can decide if tests are needed, or if observation is enough.  We need to consider the “mechanism of injury,” meaning how it happened and what force was involved.  A child may seem fine after being struck in the head by a baseball, but such high-speed impacts need evaluation regardless of how well the kid is acting. Here are more criteria for needing to get seen now: car wrecks where the child is thrown from the car, another passenger in the car dies, or the car rolls over.  If he is hit by a car while walking, or while riding a bike without a helmet, that’s concerning.  Kids under two years old need to be evaluated if they fall from over three feet; kids over two, falls higher than 5 feet.  If an infant or toddler under two gets a “goose egg” swelling anywhere but the forehead, that is worrisome. However, most kids who hit their heads are okay and can stay home.  Kids who fall from their own, standing height, are usually fine.  Kids who hit their heads but are not knocked out and go back to playing are okay too.  Toddlers who run into walls also don’t generate enough force to hurt themselves badly. Several times per week in the Emergency Department, we see a baby who rolls off the bed or falls from the stroller.   Mom is understandably freaked out- “I just left the room for a second, she has never rolled over before!”  Most falls occur at home and are usually either from falling off beds or other furniture, tumbling down stairs, or from being dropped. Interventions used only weeks ago to keep baby safe are now obsolete due to the child’s developing abilities.  Add to that the distractions of other children, pets, dinner on the stove, and the rest of the household confusion, and stuff will happen. Like we said above, after most falls the child doesn’t need an Emergency Department visit.  If baby fell from a height less than three feet, then he is probably fine. Further, if he is acting normally, doesn’t have any “goose egg” swelling on his head (except for the forehead- a goose egg there is okay), doesn’t vomit, and is acting well, he is okay.  If you are unsure, call your doctor.  The doctor can help decide if baby can be observed at home or needs to come in. Many parents believe they must keep their child awake after a fall to prevent coma. However, this is an “old wive’s tale.”  Naps after a minor fall can be restorative and comforting.  If there is a question about how bad the injury was, we do like an observation period where the child is watched for warning signs (severe headache, vomiting, changes in behavior, confusion).  During normal waking hours this is easy. However, if it is nap or bed time baby can go to sleep, but you should wake him up hourly for a few hours.  If the child is alert after waking (as alert as a child who’s just been awakened can be!), then okay.  If she seems overly groggy or lethargic, call your doctor or come in. Unlike the old man in the nursery rhyme, most kids who bump their heads and go to bed are perfectly fine- they are not old men!  Someone needs to write a new nursery rhyme for kids who bump their heads. Posted in Head Injury | Leave a reply Baby Fall Go Boom Posted on May 2, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Leslie Birdsong, a family practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. You are downstairs doing a million things.  Your kids are upstairs playing, making sounds like herding elephants.  Suddenly you hear a louder crash.  You strain to listen, and have that stab of anxiety: what sound is next?  Laughter and more elephants, or gut-wrenching silence?  You yell up the stairs, “Is everybody ok?” More silence.  Now you are truly frightened and bound up the stairs . Every parent fears their child having a head injury.  Head injuries make up many hospital visits for kids.  Here are some numbers: In kids less than 14 years, yearly there are over 500,000 Emergency Department visits for head injuries.  37,000 of those kids get admitted to the hospital for observation, or surgery.  So when do you need to bring your child to the hospital?  Here are some rules. We divide head injuries into two groups: those younger than two years old, and those two and older.  This is because younger children react differently to head injuries. They are more difficult to assess because they can’t tell us what’s wrong. Also, infants may not show many outward signs of injury. In kids less than two, here are the rules.  1.  Is the child walking, talking, and acting well for their age when we see them in the ED?  2.  Is the child acting like themselves for mom and dad?  You are with your child a whole lot more than the 10 minutes we get. Tell us if your kid is acting “funny.”  3. Are there big lumps on the scalp? Swelling and bruises on the forehead are okay, but swelling on other parts of the skull needs checking.  4.  Did the child lose consciousness?  Any child that gets knocked out should be seen.  5.  Was the injury mechanism severe?  If a child falls over from standing and hits her head- no big deal.  But a fall on the head from greater than three feet could be trouble.  A fender-bender car crash doesn’t require an evaluation, but if the car rolled over the kids need to be checked.  Impacts from baseball bats and golf clubs- bring ‘em in! For little kids, the common and scary scenario is usually like above- the parent hears boom and then silence.  For older kids it is the call from the school or worse, from the police- your child has had an accident.  Still, most older kids have mild head injuries they easily shake off.  The rules to assess children older than two are a little different than the ones for the babies and toddlers from above. 1.  Is the child awake, alert, and acting normally?  2.  Was the kid knocked out?  3.  Is the child vomiting?  Note that vomiting is NOT on the list for kids under two years- they can vomit just from crying really hard or gagging on mucus.  But if kids over two are vomiting because of a head injury- that worries us.  4.  Does the child have a bad headache?  The littler kids can’t tell us about this but the older kids can, and that counts.  5.  Was the mechanism of injury severe?  This means falls onto the head from greater than 5 feet, a car roll-over, or an impact from a thrown baseball or swung bat. When a kid meets any of these criteria, they may need a CT scan of the brain.  CT scan helps find bad things like bleeding in the brain or skull fractures.  So why don’t we just scan every kid and be sure?  No, it’s not about the money.  CT scan uses lots of radiation, up to 500 times the radiation of a regular x-ray.  Our physician motto “Do No Harm” comes into play.  The benefit of seeing into the skull needs to outweigh the risk of future cancers. What is the bottom line here?  If your child falls down and goes boom and has any of the signs we listed, get him seen.  If you are unsure if any of the rules above are positive, call your doctor.  But if you have good answers for all the rules, then all baby needs after falling and going boom is a hug and a kiss on the noggin. Posted in Head Injury | Leave a reply Head Injury Fears, Myths, Precautions Posted on August 21, 2009 by klfydoctor 5 People used to have difficulty naming their fears about when their child hit their head.  Now their fear has a name- Natasha Richardson.  Everyone has heard a story like the famous actress’s.  A person hit their head, looked well at first, then did not wake up in the morning. Fortunately, this story of delayed death after head injury is rare in adults.  It is almost unheard of in kids.  When children hit their head the severity is obvious right away.  They come to the ED in two distinct presentations- still unconscious and obviously very sick; or they come in awake, alert, and essentially well. When can you stay home with your head-injured child then, and avoid a costly and time-consuming ED visit?  Here are the good signs:  your child was not “knocked-out,” his fall was from a distance less than three times his own height, he has no vomiting, and he has no headache.  Some toddlers will get sleepy after crying their hearts out from their sore head.  That is OK- you can let your child sleep, as long as she has not vomited, has drank a little, and acted “with it” since the injury.  After an hour or two, if your child has not awakened, you should wake her up to be sure she walks and acts normally. What about when baby falls off the bed or out of the car seat and hits her head?   Babies are a little different than older kids- they get skull fractures more easily.  A baby under a year old who hits her head should get checked out if she has any swelling on her scalp.  Of course, she also needs to be seen if she has any loss of consciousness, vomiting, or acts “out of it.” What if your child was knocked out, is vomiting, or complains of a headache?  Certainly bring him in to get checked out, but don’t panic.  Most of those kids have a concussion but not a bad brain bruise or brain bleeding.  A concussion is when the patient get “his bells rung.”  He feels tired, sick to his stomach, has a headache.  After a normal CT scan, if he can drink without vomiting, he can go home.  The concussion might last for days. The one really important precaution for concussions is that the patient must not take a risk of hitting their head again while they are sick.  The child must not do sports or other risky activity until cleared by their own doctor in a follow-up exam.

Later that afternoon his professor replied- it was just a mistake. My son’s final exam grade had not been entered into the system yet, which triggered the fail mark.  It would be fixed, and my son breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  But it took some time to shake that feeling of dread that haunted him for half the day.  Anxiety can be sticky. Many teens, and elementary school kids too, are plagued by anxiety.  There’s school- worry about grades, fear of bullying, tense relations with teachers.  Home can make a kid anxious too- divorce, yelling, sometimes abuse. Many kids have concerns about their neighborhood- they have to live with the threat of crime, violence, and drug dealers on the corner.  Finally, kids see the news too, and worry about the world.  They hear stories about environmental collapse, threat of deadly epidemics, and the possibility of nuclear armageddon. We are born with the tendency to be anxious.  Anxiety is a motivator cultivated by evolution, keeping us from getting eaten.  Worried about that sabre-toothed tiger eyeing you?  Good, run away!  Even animals as primitive as lizards have anxiety.  Just approach one, watch it twitch and scuttle about, before tearing off. Some kids and adults are better at handling anxiety than others.  And many kids have manifestations of anxiety that look like illness.  That’s when we see them in the Emergency Department.  Sometimes the signs in kids are subtle- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue.  Sometimes they have more concerning symptoms, like chest pain or fainting. And occasionally we see true panic attacks. When I was in high school, worried about getting grades good enough to be a doctor, I failed a french test.  The big red “F” on the paper burned into my brain at first period. But it wasn’t until fifth period that I became shaky, broke out in sweat, and was led sobbing to the nurse.  She called my parents to admonish them about putting too much pressure on me.  My mom replied, “It’s not us!  The stupid doctor thing is all his idea!” Anxiety can make kids short of breath, and thus parents bring them to the Emergency Department. Some are just hyperventilating, but kids with asthma can have true attacks triggered by anxiety.  In fact, in the mid-twentieth century, when medicine was full of freudian theory, many thought asthma was a psychological disorder.  Even in the face of real wheezing, the noise was attributed to patients’ “suppressed cries for help”- wheezing was those cries fighting to get out. Fortunately, asthma is now recognized as true disease. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a panic attack and medical emergencies like asthma.  Both kids have trouble breathing.  Both complain about chest pain and tightness.  And whether their shortness of breath is due to airway narrowing or panic, either kid looks anxious!  Occasionally it can be tough for even doctors to tell panic attacks and asthma apart, despite stethoscopes and oxygen monitoring. How do we manage anxiety?  Kids handle anxiety differently.  Some aren’t bothered by stress, those proverbial ducks letting worries roll off their backs like water.  But some need help.  Counseling can help kids tell the difference between true medical problems like headaches and stomachaches, and those symptoms being triggered by worry. Many don’t recognize when they’re having anxiety, and knowing if you’re anxious, and why, is a big step in coping with it. Counselors can also help kids identify management strategies.  For some, exercise helps “burn off” anxiety.  For others it’s prayer, meditation, yoga or other relaxation techniques.  A few kids need medication, to temporarily get them through rough patches as they learn to cope. If you think your child is anxious, talk to them about their feelings, and maybe see their doctor to explore it more.  You want to do that before worry becomes panic attacks, and needing to come see me.

Posted on December 5, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply The child had odd markings on his back.  He was three years old and being seen in the Emergency Department for coughing.  The resident first examined the boy and noted red streaks up and down his back.  The rash looked like it was drawn on by marker.  Or a branding iron.  Concerned that the child was being physically abused, the resident brought me in to look. When I saw the marks, I breathed a sigh of relief.  “This isn’t abuse.  This is from ‘coining’,” I explained.  The family was vietnamese, and coining is an asian tradition of heating a coin and rubbing it on the back to draw out the “bad humours” causing the child’s cough.  They were not abusing their child, only trying to make him better. We occasionally see or hear about alternative practices in the ED, what modern medicine now calls “Complementary and Alternative Medicine,” or CAM.  CAM includes traditional practices like herbology, acupuncture, chiropracty, and in Louisiana, the Traiteur. Surveys show that many more people are using CAM therapies on themselves and their kids than doctors hear about.  People are often uncomfortable telling their doctor about such practices, fearing they will be ridiculed for using what many physicians regard as quackery. However, the line between “modern” medicine and CAM is starting to blur.  As certain non-medical therapies are shown by science to help patients get better, they have become adopted by modern medicine.  Such therapies include diet modification and probiotics, massage in kids with chronic pain, and play therapy for kids in the hospital.  The NIH now has a research section called the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, to study the validity of these practices.  The American Academy of Pediatrics also has a Section On Integrative Medicine with the same purpose.  In fact, some doctors get extra training in CAM therapies to ”integrate” CAM into their practice. Now, some alternative medicine seems down right kooky.  Once in medical school, I was watching a woman in labor.  The Labor and Delivery nurse was an older, experienced, no-nonsense professional.  She took a clear history about the pregancy and competently assessed the contractions and cervical dilation.  But then this all-business nurse said to the woman, “We will need some more positive energy for this delivery,” and began to hover her hands up and down over the patient’s swollen belly, murmuring about boosting energy, acting like a wizard from the movies.  The nurse’s sudden change and what she was doing blew my mind.  Was this really happening, in a real hospital?  Was this Labor and Delivery, or the Psych Ward? As I reflect on this memory now, I have more sympathy for that nurse.  I pray, go to church, and believe God gives me strength for the many stresses and occasional tragedies in pediatric emergencies.  But Christianity seems kooky to my sister-in-law, who is an athiest.  To her the universe is a machine, needing no diety to run it.  My belief in an unseen God and Holy Spirit is just as silly to her as the Labor nurse’s invoking positive energy with her hands.  However, this illustrates why many people use alternative medicine- it fits their belief systems, they are comfortable with it, and they feel it helps. As we discussed above, scientific medicine is now researching alternative CAM therapies.  Science is powerful- it has given us antibiotics, cancer cures, anesthesia.  Science also realizes that belief is powerful too, and is testing the limits of what we believe will work and what actually will work.  Science has already revealed the danger of some alternative medicines- St. John’s Wort and chelation therapy in autism, for example. Science has also started to show that traditional practices like acupuncture, chiropracty, and massage may have real therapeutic benefits. So don’t be afraid to talk about “alternative” therapy with your child’s doctor.  The doctor may already know more about these practices than you think.  Your kid’s doctor needs to know about these, to help counsel you about which practices are safe and which aren’t. However, if your doctor starts passing his hands over your child and murmuring incantations, maybe the doctor has gone too far. Posted in Alternative Medicine | Leave a reply Herbs and Acupuncture: “Real” Medicine? Posted on May 12, 2011 by klfydoctor 2 Sometimes when a parent is talking about her sick child, I hear about things they have already tried to make the kid better.   Usually these are the regular things like pain medicines or hot compresses.  Sometimes parents try things that sound wacky- blowing cigarette smoke in the child’s ear for ear pain, taking the child to a traiteur, or rolling hot coins on the child’s back (for chest congestion).  Many parents are afraid to tell their doctors about such “alternative medicine” practices, for fear that the doctors will fuss at them for not sticking to ”traditional,” science-based medicine. I try not to be judgemental when parents tell me such things (except for the cigarette smoke- c’mon!).  First, I want parents to feel safe that they can tell me everything I could use to figure out what’s wrong.  Some experts say that as many as one third of all patients use some alternative medicine along with traditional medicine, and I want to hear about it. Secondly, I can’t be too judgemental because much of traditional medicine has not actually been tested in a scientific way.  Science examines medicines and therapies by “blinding” the people being treated and the doctors giving the treatment.  In other words, neither doctor nor patient know who is getting the true medicine, or a placebo (fake medicine).  Thus their biases and feelings about whether something will work or not will not sway the results.  Experts figure that only about one third of traditional treatments, medicines, and surgeries have been tested scientifically! Fortunately, nowadays modern medicine is cleaning house.  A movement  called “evidence-based medicine” is testing all current practices, tossing out those that truly don’t help, and promoting those that do.  Some traditional medicines are being thrown out, like cold medicines.  Other medicine’s uses are being modified, like careful use of antibiotics.  Surgical techniques are being discarded or improved with a more scientific knowledge of their usefulness. Scientific medicine is also starting to test alternative medicines and practices  like herbs, acupuncture, and chiropracty.  (By the way, many modern medicines are herb-derived, like digoxin (foxglove) and aspirin (willow bark), so what is really traditional versus alternative?)  There is now some evidence that treatments like acupuncture and probiotics may have value.  Other treatments, like St. John’s wort, have been shown to have bad side effects.   Good studies of alternative medicine are just getting started, so stay tuned. In the mean time, don’t be afraid to talk to your doctor about all treatments you have tried.  Your doctor should be up on the latest about alternative medicine, and be able to guide you about what is safe and effective, what is not, and what we don’t know yet.  One thing is absolutely for certain- cigarette smoke is really, really bad.  Please leave that off your child’s treatment plan! 5/16 Addendum: Red Lerille cornered me today at the gym and asked jokingly, “Hey, what’s wrong with traiteurs?”  I answered, “Absolutely nothing, they can only help!”   I believe in the power of prayer.  In fact, scientists have actually done studies to see if prayer helps make people get better.  The answer: they can’t be certain yet, but maybe!

Life gets pretty busy for kids when they become teenagers, and they start using caffeine too.  They use it to stay up with school work or with friends, then drink it to wake up the next morning.  And as we all know, many teenagers cannot get enough of a good thing, and start to overuse stimulants.  Teenagers overuse stimulants in two ways: by drinking energy drinks, and by taking Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder medications that are not theirs. Energy drinks like Red Bull, Monster Energy, and Rockstar became popular in the 1980s.  They were invented to give more of what one could get from a cup of coffee- more sugar, more caffeine.  They tasted terrible (still do), but marketing them as the drink for the really busy got people to try them.  Since they worked, people got hooked. Energy drinks work because they have a lot more caffeine and sugar than coffee or cola.  They contain caffeine plus a substance called guarana, which is essentially a high-potency version of caffeine.  Energy drinks can be so potent that besides use as a wake-up or study aid, some teenagers drink them to get a ”high.”  When mixed with alcohol, the energy drink and the alcohol enhance each other’s effects, and the high is multiplied. The potency of energy drinks makes them a problem for us in the Emergency business.  We see many teenagers in the Emergency Department with complaints of chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and anxiety.  These conditions are often benign, but they are made worse, and happen more often, with the use of energy drinks.  Take a teenager with anxiety and school pressure, amp him up on an energy drink, and the anxiety gets amped up too.  When energy drinks are mixed with alcohol, alcohol effects are worse as well- more car accidents from drunk driving, more fights, more alcohol poisoning. Another stimulant teenagers are using a lot are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder medications like Adderall, Concerta, and Vyvanse.  Children and teens with ADHD are often helped by stimulants to keep awake the part of their brain that helps them stay focused and calm.  The medicines are mostly derivatives of amphetamine, the drug known as “speed.”  Many high school and college students without ADHD use these medications as a study aid.  They buy them from kids with ADHD for a few dollars per pill (the price goes up at finals time!). These stimulants can be effective study aids.  The non-ADHD teen uses them to stay awake to study for a test or pull an all-nighter to write a paper.  Two kinds of teens use these meds.  One is the kid who failed to plan his school work and left a lot for the last minute.  The other is the highly competitive kid in a highly competitive school environment, trying to stay ahead of his classmates. Though ADHD medicines often work for these kids, they bring many problems.  They are addictive.  Typical teens will try a pill for a one-time study session.  It works so well that they start using it for more tests, then to write papers, then to just get through their piles of homework.  Eventually it is a steady cycle of blasting through work on an amphetamine high, followed by crashing and sleeping it off, often accompanied by weight loss and depression. Also, it is illegal for kids to take these medications without a prescription.  It is illegal for kids with ADHD to sell them.  It is also just plain cheating to use stimulants for school work.  Just like it is cheating for professional athletes to use these and other performance-enhancing drugs to get ahead in their sports, it is cheating for teens to use them to get better grades. Finally, these drugs have the same side effects as energy drinks, only worse.  Anxiety, tachycardia, hyperventilation, sleep deprivation, and post-high depression are all problems that bring teen users into the Emergency Department.  Even worse, these medications bring risks like heart arrhythmias and sudden death to the user who has not had a proper medical screen by a doctor. So help your teens to avoid wanting to use energy drinks or illegal stimulants to get school work done.  Help them learn good time management, study habits, and sleep habits when they are younger.  Learning those good habits is not only good for managing school work; they help when planning life.  And if they feel like a pick-me-up, if they “feel the need for speed,” buy them a cup of coffee.

LGMC offers a team of dedicated professionals who are highly skilled and dedicated to improving the care and ultimate outcome for stroke patients though a rapid triage response, evidence-based treatment approaches, patient/family support and ongoing stroke education. After undergoing an on-site evaluation and demonstrating compliance with nationally developed standards for stroke care, LGMC earned The Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval ™ for certification as an Advanced Primary Stroke Center. We are now highlighted on the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s “Stroke Center Near You” website , signifying that LGMC is providing ""next generation stroke care."" This certification means Lafayette General has the ability to provide effective, timely care to stroke victims and can significantly improve outcomes. LGMC offers its stroke services 24 hours / 7 days a week. Each year about 795,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke, which is the nation's third leading cause of death. On average, someone suffers a stroke every 40 seconds and someone dies of a stroke every 3.1 minutes. Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States, with about 4.7 million stroke survivors alive today. The Joint Commission's Primary Stroke Center Certification is based on the recommendations for primary stroke centers published by the Brain Attack Coalition and the American Stroke Association's statements and guidelines for stroke care. The Joint Commission launched the program—the nation's first—in 2003. A list of programs certified by The Joint Commission is available at http://www.qualitycheck.org/ . With seven neurologists and nine neurosurgeons on staff, backed by a host of critical care specialists, Lafayette General continues to work diligently to ensure that stroke protocols meet national benchmarks for best practices. LGMC's Stroke Program offers the full continuum of care from the Emergency Department all the way to rehabilitation at Lafayette General Southwest's Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Unit. The stroke rehabilitation unit located achieved The Joint Commission's Disease Specific Certification as a Stroke Rehab Unit in 2015.  In addition, Acadiana Stroke Support Group meets in the Second Floor Classroom, Suite 2500, at Lafayette General Southwest Medical Office Building at 3 p.m. on the second Tuesday of every month. Warning signs and symptoms of stroke: Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden, severe headache with no known cause If you, or someone you are with, has one or more stroke symptoms that lasts more than a few minutes, don't delay! Immediately call 9-1-1 . DO NOT drive yourself. DO check the time when the first warning sign or symptom began. You or the person who is with you will be asked this important question later. After a stroke, it may seem that no one understands what you're going through. You may feel isolated and adrift. The Acadiana Stroke Support Group is here to help. We are a support system for survivors and families, to provide that 'life raft' of hope and understanding on the road to recovery.

One midnight in Baltimore, I was on duty in the Pediatric ED when my wife called: our son awoke struggling to breathe, such that he couldn’t even talk.  Miles away, I could only help over the phone.  I gave the standard pediatrician’s advice for croup : take him outside, keep him upright.  His breathing subsided, everyone calmed down, and I called in a prescription to the 24 hour pharmacy.  Croup can be scary, yet easily managed.  This week’s guest columnist, Dr. Leslie Sizemore, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette, explains: In the fall physicians prepare for the typical fall and winter illnesses. Everyone thinks of influenza virus (“ the flu”) but we also worry about RSV, mycoplasma (“walking pneumonia”), common cold, and the ever recognizable croup. What is croup?  Croup starts like any cold- dry cough, runny nose, hoarseness, and sometimes fever.  The characteristic “barking cough” comes about 12-48 hours later. The barking lasts about 3 days but the rest of the cold may take around 7 days to resolve. Sometimes croup comes on suddenly at night, with a previously well child awakening with the barking cough and shortness of breath. Croup is caused by inflammation at the top of your windpipe, called the trachea, just below your vocal cords.  When these pipes get inflamed, they swell and the breathing space gets narrower.  The smaller space compresses the air during cough, making that strange cough like a barking seal.  If the swelling worsens, the child gets stridor, which is a high pitched whistling sound when breathing in.  When the airway is narrow enough to make stridor, kids really starting struggling to breathe. We see croup mostly in the fall, October being the peak month.  This coincides with a peak in parainfluenza virus, the most common cause of croup.  Croup is mostly seen in kids age 6 months to 3 years, and is unusual beyond age 6.  Viruses that cause croup are spread by close contact, just like any cold. Most cases of croup are mild with occasional barking cough, hoarseness, and maybe a little stridor when crying.  It is the more severe cases we worry about, when the swelling of the windpipe gets worse.  Then the child has that whistling stridor sound even at rest. These children need to get seen immediately.  If the airway gets too narrow the child may no longer be able to breath.  The good news is that less than 5% of kids with croup get put in the hospital, so these bad cases are rare. How do we treat this nasty illness?  Since it is caused by a virus, we all know that antibiotics won’t help, since they don’t kill viruses.  We treat the symptoms while the child’s immune system gets rid of the virus.  We treat the airway inflammation with anti-inflammatory medicine- steroids.  This can be done in two ways: the child can be given a one-time shot, or be given three days of a liquid steroid by mouth. We all know which one the kid would prefer! If the child is having stridor, we give them a breathing treatment with a medicine called epinephrine.  The breathing treatment, or nebulizer, is that pipe commonly used by asthmatics that turns medicine into a mist that is inhaled.  But instead of the albuterol that kids with asthma need, we put in epinephrine. The epinephrine relaxes the muscles that line the windpipe.  We give this medicine only in the Emergency Department, not at home.  This is because the child needs to be watched for several hours after the treatment.  Sometimes kids who get the epinephrine treatment have “rebound,” where the stridor comes back within an hour, sometimes coming back worse. For the other croup symptoms, you treat them like any other cold.  Give Tylenol or ibuprofen for fever and throat soreness.  Run a vaporizer by the bed for moist air to lubricate those inflamed airways.  Prop up the child’s head to help minimize gagging on secretions.  Give plenty of fluids, and in a few days your child should get better and go on about his business, no longer imitating a barking seal.

Lafayette General Health employs a team of exceptional Family Medicine and Internal Medicine physicians, to see patients at a number of facilities across Acadiana. The role of the primary care physician is to be your go-to, regular doctor for any general medical needs and inquiries. With a regular primary care physician, the doctor gets to know you better and become familiar with your background, medical history, routines and family history. The more doctors know about their patients, the more likely their outcomes will be better. Sometimes, your primary care physician is unavailable. In those instances, Lafayette General Health partners with a hospitalist services program to provide experienced primary care practitioners to serve hospital patients so that you're left in quality hands. You can then return to seeing your primary care physician once you are out of the hospital. In addition, Lafayette General has three Urgent Care Centers that provide treatment for minor illness and injuries when your primary care physician isn’t able to see you after hours or due to a full schedule. After your urgent care visit, your updated medical record is available to your primary care physician, keeping them informed of your recent medical visit. $(document).ready(function () {

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Picky Eaters No Clean-Plate-Clubs Here Posted on January 23, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply A high school friend of mine, Alice Flaherty, was a picky eater.  Alice could only stomach a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  She went on to become a famous Harvard Neurologist and had a picky eater for a daughter.  So she wrote a terrific children’s book called “The Luck Of The Lock Ness Monster,” which is available at the Lafayette Public Library.  The little girl in the book is of course a picky eater, and during an ocean voyage throws her oatmeal overboard every morning rather than eat it.  A little worm swimming by the ship turns out to love oatmeal, eats it up every morning the girl dumps it, and grows to be the Loch Ness Monster.  More fun stuff happens in the book, but the point is clear.  It is okay to be a picky eater. However, many parents fret over their kids who don’t scarf down their food.  They worry that their kids won’t gain weight, won’t grow well, and will be sickly.  Then when the child does get sick and eats even less, the parent’s worry magnifies and they rush to the doctor or worse, the Emergency Department. Some kids are just picky eaters.  One in five kids do this, and certainly a whole 20% of the child population is not wasting away.  Picky eaters grow well, gain weight, and develop strong brains and bodies.  When they get sick they often eat even less, but so do the “good” eaters.  And when they get well the picky eaters will go back to eating the amount that is normal for them just like the “good” eaters, and catch up on their weight. Picky eating only really becomes a problem when parents make it one.  Some parents can’t leave well enough alone.  They badger their kids to eat more, to clean their plates. They argue with each other and the child about eating.  They make their child stay at the table longer than everyone else.  Meals become an endless fight, a power struggle that both child and parent resent. Or some parents go to the other extreme, cooking special foods just for that picky child.  Some let the child snack on junk food endlessly. The solution to picky eating is to let the child be picky!  Don’t push and push the kid to eat- that won’t work, and it makes eating more of a chore than it already is.  Don’t make the child stay at the table until they clean their plate either- let them get up when everyone else does, whether they finish their portion or not. Certainly give the child food that is easier to eat.  Food that is too chewy like steak, or too hard like raw vegetables, will not be eaten.  Strong flavors like spicy, acidy, or sour won’t be a hit.  On the other hand, don’t go to extremes to accommodate the picky eater.  Don’t cook different food just for them, let them eat what everyone else is having.  If they don’t like something particular that everyone else does, that is okay.  Encourage the child to try one bite, and then take it or leave it (it can take more than five tries before a child discovers that they like something!). If the child just won’t eat anything that you prepared, have a back-up food that is easy for you and that they will eat, so they won’t be hungry later.  Good back up foods are simple sandwiches, yogurt, breakfast cereal.  Again, don’t fix anything special- no need for a special production when you have already cooked for everyone else. Finally, don’t make a meal into a fight.  Meal time is time for the family to get together and have pleasant conversation and good time together.  No drama necessary!  No arguing about food or dessert or clean plates, keep it upbeat. When should you worry about eating?  Only when the child has scale-proven weight loss over a period of weeks.  If a child or teen steadily loses weight, then it is time to see your doctor.  Weight loss could mean diabetes, depression, anorexia, or other serious conditions.  However, picky eaters still gain weight and grow, so if that is the case, no worries!  Picky eating is okay, clean plate or not.

As an Advanced Primary Care Stroke Center, the Stroke Center at LGMC is featured on the American Stroke Association’s website as a “Stroke Center Near You.” The Stroke Center certification means LGMC has the ability to provide effective, timely care to stroke victims and can significantly improve outcomes for stroke patients. The hospital also offers seizure and headache management services. LGMC is also home to CyberKnife® Center of Louisiana . CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery is the newest technology to treat tumors in the brain and elsewhere in the body without an incision, pain or anesthesia. One of the greatest benefits of neurological care at LGMC is its continuum of services that provide a smooth transition from pre-surgery preparation to inpatient recovery. LGMC has a dedicated rehabilitation floor staffed with nurses and therapists. Their sole purpose is to quickly and safely get patients as independent as possible and able to return home. The rehabilitation program includes physical, occupational and speech therapies. Find a Neurologist Find a Neurosurgeon Deep Brain Stimulation Deep Brain Stimulation, often referred to as DBS therapy, surgically implants a medical device, similar to a cardiac pacemaker, under the collarbone. The device delivers electrical impulses through very thin wires to precisely targeted areas of the brain associated with motor control and muscle function. Electrical stimulation of these areas of the brain offsets the tremors from conditions associated with Essential Tremor, dystonia and Parkinson’s Disease. The stimulation can be programmed, turned off and on or adjusted non-invasively by a trained clinician to maximize symptom control and minimize side effects. Renowned neurosurgeon Alan Appley, M.D., with Acadiana Neurosurgery, performs the DBS procedure at Lafayette General Medical Center. DBS therapy is proven to reduce some of the most disabling symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease and Essential Tremor, including: stiffness or inflexibility of the limbs or joints; slowness/absence of movement; and involuntary, rhythmic shaking of a limb, the head or the entire body. Interventional Neurology Interventional Neurology is a medical specialty that utilizes advanced imaging equipment to perform minimally invasive procedures to treat complex diseases of the brain, neck and spine. One of the objectives Interventional Neurology at Lafayette General Medical Center is to improve stroke care and to enhance quality of life for stroke survivors.  Interventional Neurologists provide a number of treatment options for patients needing alternatives to more invasive surgical procedures.  They also offer expanded therapeutic options for individuals who might be ineligible for treatment. For example, in cases of ischemic stroke, where a patient arrives at the hospital beyond the timeframe for traditional treatment, the Interventional Neurologist could offer lifesaving alternatives.  In addition to stroke, Interventional Neurologists could also treat vascular malformations, arteriovenous malformations, vasospasms, aneurysms and tumors.

Posted on December 2, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, Christmas is only slightly safer for kids than riding bikes no hands, eyes closed, on the roof.  The AAP website has a three page list on avoiding flaming disaster in the living room.  To be fair, their are some extra hazards in the season.  However, my experience in Pediatric Emergency is less about Ralphie shooting out his eye with a Red Rider B.B. Gun, and more about toddlers chewing Christmas tree light bulbs. Toddlers love putting brightly colored, shiny objects in their mouths.  Decorative light bulbs have thin glass, easily cracked when bitten. Fortunately, the curious kids get only a few minor cuts in their mouths and quickly heal. Occasionally we see more traumatic ingestions when toddlers get a tiny bit of Christmas lodged in their airway or esophagus and need surgery for removal. No matter how well your house is toddler-proofed, with cabinets locked and choking hazards swept away, Christmas undoes all that.  It’s impossible to police boxes of decorations, toys with tiny pieces, things hanging off Christmas tree branches. Thus one more holiday stress: having to watch your cruising babies extra carefully with all that stuff around.  Best advice: keep decoration ambitions small and manageable. The next realistic Christmas safety worry is kids and dogs.  Kids and dogs interact more during the holidays, either with new dogs as presents, or visiting friends and relatives with dogs.  Trouble starts when kids want to meet the pooch, poochie gets nervous about approaching strangers, and bites them in the face. Best advice: don’t get a new dog until your children are 5 years-old, when they can learn to treat animals safely. Closely supervise interactions between your child and others’ pets. Fires are another seasonal worry.  The Christmas tree tradition started in Germany, with candles on them for illumination.  My dad lived there in the 1950s and told of proud Germans who eschewed electric bulbs for old-fashioned candles, and the busy Fire Brigades racing from one tragic house fire to another.  Even with electric bulbs, trees fires are possible. Trees dry out easily, are covered with flammable ornaments, kindled with paper wrapped gifts, and stand next to overloaded power sockets.  Keep tree water filled, and unplug lights overnight. Besides physical risks for kids at Christmas, the season is emotionally stressful. Parents get overwhelmed, and kids too.  We’re looking for Peace On Earth and Good Will among men, yet find ourselves cutting each other off for parking spaces at the mall. One source of stress is that during Christmas we are supposed to be happy, and are disappointed when the season isn’t any happier than usual.  The disappointment is even more acute when we become less happy due to seasonal hassles. The list of things that drag on us at Christmas continues: overeating, driving through traffic to shop in mad crowds, dragging decorations out, extra cooking.  And while visiting family is usually a good time, you also visit some you don’t like (you moved so far away for a reason). Kids get stressed too. They overeat, and eat too many things that cause stomach-aches. They stay up too late, and are exhausted the next day.  They get sick- it’s the cold and flu season after all.  And parents aren’t paying them enough attention because we’re too busy on a regular day, and adding a Christmas list makes that worse. Besides the safety cautions from above, you need a strategy to minimize holiday hassles for you and your kids.  Most importantly, keep it small.  When it comes to decorations and shopping, small and tasteful beats big and garish.  Make small amounts of special Christmas food and involve the kids when you do, so cooking becomes more of a positive for you both. Second most important: keep the kids’ routine.  Make bedtimes and meal times pretty normal.  If things get chaotic, kids get more stressed.  Again, make sure your kids are mostly eating a regular healhy diet.  And like we say in almost every column in this series, everyone’s should wash hands- that’s the best prevention for illness. Humorist Dave Barry wrote: “No matter how hectic it gets, you need to remember what the holidays are all about…exactly how much can you charge on your credit cards before going to jail?”  Don’t be that Christmas parent; keeping it simpler equals Peace On Earth.

Libby Going and Rati Venkatesh, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. In the Pediatric Emergency Department, we see lots of coughs, fevers, injuries of all sorts, and concerns about kid’s teeth.  While infrequent, parents sometimes come to ask about tooth care.  And we see lots of visits for tooth and mouth trauma. We saw a precious two year-old girl recently, with big brown eyes a red bow in her hair, and a runny nose.  She was bubbly and fun but when she smiled, her teeth took away some pizazz.  They were brown stubs, an obvious case of “bottle rot.”  Her parents had been putting her to bed with a bottle, the milk sitting in her mouth all night, destroying her teeth. Dental care is important early in life.  Start good habits for both baby teeth and permanent teeth.  Even before baby has teeth you should gently clean his gums with a wet washcloth.  When you see that first tooth and document it in the baby book, it’s time to start cleaning that tooth.  Use a soft baby toothbrush and a very tiny smear of toothpaste. When you celebrate that first big birthday, baby enjoys her first cake, and you get that picture with icing all over her face and high chair.  Then it’s time to schedule a dentist appointment.  The first visits to the dentist are for a check-up, and to get the child used to the dentist. Dental visits aren’t the horror we feared when we were kids- children should learn early that dentistry is pretty painless. What your child eats is also important for healthy teeth.  Sippy cups filled with juice or milk (or worse, soda!) lead to tooth decay.  Limit juice or milk to meal time only, with water offered the rest of the day.  And again, no bed time bottles after you have gently brushed those pearly whites. Falls, sports injuries, and plain horsing around cause all sorts of injuries, but one of the scariest is a knocked-out tooth.  There’s screaming, blood, and an ugly gap.  What to do depends on whether it’s a baby tooth, or a permanent one.  Baby teeth usually start coming out in the first two years, and fall out on their own about age 6.  They are then replaced by the permanent teeth, which need to last the rest of the child’s life. The best way to handle knocked-out teeth is prevention.  Mouth and face guards are very important for sports at risk for tooth injury- those with regular impacts, sticks, and flying objects- like football, baseball, hockey, softball, and lacrosse.  Cheering too- cheerleaders are often flying objects themselves! What to do when a tooth gets popped out?  If it’s a baby tooth, don’t worry, just call your dentist.  Your kid may have a gapped-tooth picture for awhile, but her permanent tooth should grow in fine.  If it’s a permanent tooth, that’s more trouble.  It’s important to get that tooth back in so it won’t die, but take root and live. First, pick up the tooth by the whitest part (the crown)- don’t touch the root.  If it’s dirty, rinse it for 10 seconds only.  Then match it to it’s hole and push the root into the socket.  Have your child bite down on a cloth to hold it in place, and call your dentist.  Put that tooth in with the outside facing out- backwards teeth make for future orthodontic trouble. Scared to put that tooth back in?  Many are, with all that blood and crying.  Have your kiddo spit into a cup, and put the tooth in the saliva.  Or put it in milk.  Then immediately see your dentist.  Teeth re-implanted within one hour have better chances of surviving. Mouth and dental emergencies can be scary, so it’s important to have a dentist by the first birthday.  Then you have an expert to call when things get hairy, and you can keep your child’s smile pretty.

The good news is that hives, or ”urticaria” in doctor-talk, by itself is not dangerous.  If your kid has had hives for an hour or two without any of that bad stuff above, rest easy.  The bad allergic reactions- throat swelling, wheezing, anaphylactic shock- happen immediately in an allergic reaction.  Hives are also quite common.  Most kids have an attack of hives sometime in their childhood, and they get over it just fine. What causes hives?  When a kid comes in covered with itchy welts, the parents have already been racking their brains for causes.  What food did he eat?  Did we use a new washing powder?  Did she get bitten by something?  It turns out that most urticaria episodes have unclear origins.  In fact, if the kid gets allergy testing after a hives outbreak, most often all the tests are negative.  Only if the child has just taken something highly allergenic before the attack, like antibiotics or allergenic foods like peanuts, do we have a possible culprit.  For most kids though, there is no obvious cause. How do you treat urticaria?  As you probably could guess, use good old Benadryl.  Benadryl is good for the itching, and makes the rash look better.  Tylenol is also good for itching and is safe to take with Benadryl.  If the Benadryl still is not enough to keep your kid happy, sometimes we add steroids. More good news about urticaria is that it is short-lived.  Most kids are better in 2 to 4 days.  Rare cases last longer, and those are the few kids who need allergy testing.  Otherwise, if your kids has hives, don’t panic!  Give some benadryl, maybe some tylenol, keep them cool and their skin soft.  And don’t go too nuts trying to figure out a cause- you won’t! Poison ivy is another common non-emergency rash that we see in the Emergency Department.  It may not be an emergency, but like hives and eczema it sure does itch like crazy, and looks awful.  It is red, streaky, and often has pustules and wet, weepy patches.  Kids commonly get it on their faces and arms and legs, since these are the places skin is exposed and brushed by the poison ivy leaves. Poison ivy is one cause of a class of rashes we call “contact dermatitis.”  In other words, any irritant that contacts your skin can cause this rash.  Other irritants, like poison oak, poison sumac, or any other thing your kid’s skin is allergic to, can cause a break out.  Myth buster: many people think poison ivy is contagious, that you can spread the “oil” that causes the rash to others.  THIS IS WRONG!  Poison ivy and other contact dermatitises are not contagious.  It seems contagious when a kid as more and more break-outs on his own body, as if he is spreading it around by scratching.  In reality, the kid is just having later breakouts where his body got a lower dose of the allergen. To treat poison ivy, we use steroids again.  Steroids are anti-inflammation medicines, and calm down the skin inflamed by the irritant.  Another myth-buster: steroid injection, the “cortisone shot,” does not work any better or faster than steroid pills or syrup.  Other treatment for poison ivy includes covering the really raw spots with bandages, and giving Tylenol or ibuprofen for the itch.  Poison ivy can take as long as a week to heal. So if your kid has poison ivy, dress the worst patches and give him or her some Tylenol for the itching.  Call your doctor for a steroid prescription and tell his teachers he is not contagious.  Tell them you heard it from me!

Posted on October 12, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply Now that football season is on again, we are seeing a lot of head injuries in the ED.  Usually the concussion is obvious- the player was knocked out, or obviously confused after the hit.  Last week though, I had a player come in for a wrist injury.  Then he told me, “by the way,” that he had had a tackle the night before where afterward, he could not remember plays or even what his own position was!  Now he had a headache- was this a problem? I asked him why he did not tell his coach about his head injury.  He told me that the coach was “crazy” about kids slacking off and did not want to upset the coach and not be put back into play.  I told this teenager and his mom about the dangers of a second hit while concussed, where brain swelling and even death are real possibilities.  Fortunately for this player, his arm had a minor fracture and his season with this coach and his head injury was over anyway (fortunately, except of course for the broken arm). Concussions are being recognized by the NFL, the NCAA, LHSAA, and other sports as a big problem.  This year the NFL has much more strict rules about putting players in after a concussion.  Watching last Sunday’s Saints game,  I noticed that after a head injury, players were being given neurological exams on the sidelines.  The Arizona quarterback, Max Hall,  was taken out for a time after a head injury, even though he wasn’t knocked out (he looked pretty dazed though, I’m surprised they let him back in). What is a concussion?  A concussion is a head injury where you have certain symptoms afterward, like confusion, headache, nausea, poor concentration, and poor coordination.  In the next few days kids with concussions can have sleepiness, depression, and poor school performance.  Repeated concussions can lead to long term problems with thinking ability and mood.  Some people with a career of head injuries, like boxers and pro football players, can have syndromes like Traumatic Encephalopathy, which is akin to early Alzheimer’s disease.  A kid with a second head injury while having concussion symptoms can end up in Intensive Care with serious brain swelling. As always, prevention is important.  Football equipment needs to be up-to-date.  Players need to be taught to tackle safely, where the player tackles with their arms and shoulders with heads up,  not “spearing’ with their heads.  The new rule is “see what you are hitting.” Coaches and trainers need to know to watch for which players might have a concussion, do a quick sideline exam, and take out players with any concussion symptoms, no matter how minor.  No need to take a chance with tragedy!  Finally, players need to return to play only when they are free of concussion symptoms.  Then they need to return to play in a step-wise fashion.  This means that after a week of healing, they return only to running and calisthenics.  If they are still symptom-free, then they can go back to running plays in practice, without contact.  Then if that is okay, they can go back to full contact. Coaches, families, and players need to be aware of concussion.  Football, soccer, basketball, hockey (ice and field) and baseball and softball players, be careful!  Cheerleaders too- cheering is now considered a full contact sport, what with cheerleaders being stacked and thrown higher and higher into the air, and occasionally dropped back onto the ground.  There is no good reason to take chances with your brain.  I know this is Louisiana and we are talking about football, but again, isn’t it only a game?

Interpersonal drama brings many kids to the Emergency Department too, particularly teenagers. Someone says the wrong thing, feelings are hurt, punches are exchanged, and we see the ensuing facial and head injuries.  Teens are particularly vulnerable to these escalations.  Already at an emotional age, with hormones surging, feelings are raw and easily chafed. Teens are also often in the early stages of learning conflict resolution. They are unskilled in managing feelings and arguments without resorting to shouting and violence. Several outside forces can inhibit teens from maturing into rational adults too.  A lot of media these days portrays immature behavior as something fun to watch and emulate. Reality TV consists of knuckleheads gossiping about each other on camera, making wars out of simple disagreements.  Then the assailants confront each other and scream obscenities for the enjoyment of the TV audience.  And the combatants are always so good-looking, just like teens want to be. Social media amplifies drama as well.  When I see fights brewing at festivals, it’s not just two teens having a tiff.  There’s usually a crowd of “friends” swirling around, egging them on, joining the shouting.  With social media, the crowd is even bigger, with unlimited gawkers available through screens and sites, taking sides, trading barbs. Simple arguments become electronically-enabled riots. Some teens learn poor conflict resolution at home too.  When some parents fight, their negotiating skills look like the Jerry Springer show. Rather than a calm discussion of differences, these parents try to intentionally hurt the other’s feelings, verbally “aiming to kill,” instead of speaking respectfully.  When kids grow up living with such behavior, they rarely learn a better way for themselves. Like we discussed above, social media can fuel conflicts between people.  Once on Facebook, I saw a picture of a friend’s teenage son at a party.  His round smiling face, his arms draped around two friends, reminded me of actor Jonah Hill  (a cute Jonah Hill, not the overweight creep he sometimes portrays). So, bonehead that I can be, I said so in a comment. The backlash from he and his parents, and my wife, still makes me cringe with embarrassment. Thus one problem with social media: it’s easier to commit a social faux pas with a keyboard.  When you’re face to face with a person, you naturally edit what you say, to not offend.  There’s non-verbal cues that help you to not say dreadful things. This in-person behavioral check doesn’t operate when interacting online. Secondly, when you’re angry at another person, this social media disconnect makes it easier to intentionally wound.  In World War II, fighter pilots were rarely troubled by killing their enemies, though viciously machine-gunning each other in one-on-one combat.  This was because they concentrated on the other plane, not the pilot inside. Likewise today, it’s easier to say the meanest thing that comes to mind online, because you’re saying it to a machine. But screens are like fighter planes- there’s a real person hidden inside that gets hurt. So how can you counter the forces of Reality TV and on-line depersonalization, that turn your teen into a screaming drama king or queen?  Begin before your child’s a teen. In pre-teen years, games should be played less on screens, and more face-to-face. Board and card games, tag and backyard ball, are all conflict-resolution exercises for kids. Negotiating the rules, playing fair, keeping friends, all happen in those arenas, not in video games. You must also model good behavior yourself.  Parents should have arguments that aren’t death matches, but calm settlings of differences. Feeling wronged and needing vengeance are innate human traits- show your kids how you bypass those cruder motivations, to stay friendly. Finally, texting and messaging are certainly convenient, but elementary school kids should spend more time together in person than on screens. Phone and computer time should be limited, like limiting how much candy kids eat. And explain that there’s real people on the other side of the screen, not computer-generated enemies.  Then it’s easier to avoid comparing someone to Jonah Hill. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply 2016- The Worst of Times? Posted on December 28, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply My son came home from college, shaking his head. His fellow millennials were lamenting that 2016 was the worst year ever: “David Bowie and Prince died!” My son’s response: “Worst year ever?  What about 1939?”  Nazis starting World War II was a lot worse than some celebrities passing away. As a pediatrician, I saw many good things about 2016. While preparing for my yearly mission trip to Honduras, I’m reminded of positives for even the most impoverished U.S. citizens- clean water, with no risk of cholera.  And while some American kids go hungry, there isn’t the abject starvation of the third world. Though we worry about the environmental impact of coal, oil production, and car exhaust, we enjoy pretty clean air compared to the third world.  Their vehicles and factories have unregulated emissions, families cook inside over open fires, and farms often practice slash-and-burn techniques. In fact, Americans suffer from too many good things.  Too much food and too much sitting around looking at screens leads to obesity.  2016 has highlighted another rising glut- too much information.  T he recent presidential race has revealed growing anxiety about which information is real, which is made up.  Is this candidate telling the truth?  Where are they getting their facts?  What are the facts, and where to find them? There was a recent political cartoon depicting two people looking at cellphones, wondering if the news they were reading was real or fake, and how they could find out. Standing behind them was a newspaper stand.  A subtext of the joke is that many no longer trust information from traditional sources, like newspaper and TV media, government, or science.  Too many conspiracy theories, too many scandals, have undermined faith in these traditional institutions. As a doctor, my decision-making relies on good data.  It’s a professional duty to find facts for the good of the patient. Newspaper and TV media and government scientists are the same.  The vast majority of journalists and scientists are professionals, diligent about getting facts right.  You can trust them for the best information, better than random websites. When looking for medical information, like about vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control or the American Academy of Pediatrics, rather than some un-credentialed crank. Besides cataloging the year’s best and worst, a favorite new year pastime is making New Year’s Resolutions.  I’m not big on resolutions myself. Doctors have to continually make new good habits and throw out old ones, as medical knowledge evolves. Nothing’s special about New Year’s when it comes to medical innovation. I don’t encourage New Year’s resolutions in others either, as humorist Dave Barry wrote, “so that you can become a better you- a more-attractive you, an organized you, a you that is…well, less like you.”  This column is always about making good habits all year, throughout your childrens’ growing-up, so they are safer and happier. Good habits aren’t actually hard to make when there’s quick results. New Year’s resolutions, the good habits that we continually fail to make, are the ones that require persistence to get to the pay-off.  Losing weight or exercising are commonly failed resolutions because it’s months before you look or feel better, while you suffer through cravings and pain.  Quick pay-off habits, like always putting your car keys in your left pocket so you never lose them, are easy to develop. Here’s an easy habit to keep your kids happy, healthy, and safe: get them a doctor and dentist.  Many kids I see in the Emergency Department don’t have these. Some kids don’t get sick much, so their parents stopped taking them for yearly check-ups. When the kids do get sick, they get taken to a walk-in clinic or ER. However, doctor and dentist practices help you keep good habits.  At yearly check-ups, they discuss how to keep your kids well, appropriate to their age and development.  If your kid’s a toddler, they discuss tooth-brushing and toddler-proofing the house.  For teenagers, it’s about acne, wearing seat belts, and not getting pregnant. My dentist’s office books my next appointment before I leave.  Six months later I get two phone calls to remind me when to come. That’s a slick outfit- they keep their patients coming in, and my my teeth stay clean.  Get your kids a dentist and doctor with such a well-run office.  They’ll do your New Year’s resolution work for you. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Ghost In The Graveyard Posted on July 15, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply There’s only about 4 weeks left of summer vacation here in Louisiana.  Summer’s been terrific, but now family vacation and your kid’s camps are done.  You’ve made some good memories, but now the kids are bored and have reverted to lounging about playing video games.  No one goes outside, with the heat during the day and the mosquitoes at dusk. However, it’s not too late to continue a great summer, have fun with the kids, and generate some more memories.  Sometimes to find ideas for this blog, I check the New York Times Wellness Blog, and recently found their series called “The Intentional Summer.” They’ve come up with more ideas for parents and kids to beat boredom and salvage what’s left of summer; and get the kids outside for more exercise.  So I’m going to shamelessly borrow from them. I asked my three kids, now grown, if they’d ever played a game called “Ghost In The Graveyard.”  The older two replied, “that rings a bell,” and my youngest had no clue. This reflects studies that kids now spend more summertime indoors than outside, as opposed to my generation who spent more time out than in.  We didn’t have video games and only 5 or 6 channels on TV, so we had to play outdoors with the neighborhood kids to avoid boredom.  Many of those kid-run games have gone forgotten. Now it’s up to parents to revive the games of their youth, for their kids. Get your kids and their friends together and teach them the classics- Flashlight Tag, Capture The Flag, and Ghost In The Graveyard.  If you don’t remember the rules, look them up online.  Once you set the kids loose, they won’t be able to stop, particularly with Ghost In The Graveyard. This game has suspense, hide-and-go-seek, and lots of running. Sending your kids outdoors takes some planning.  To beat the heat, they’ll need plenty of water, and perhaps playing in the evening when it’s cooler.  But evening is when mosquitoes are worse, so you’ll need bug spray.  But it’s worth it, for their health and happy brains. When reading the New York Times ” Intentional Summer” series, I found an excellent family activity they called the Quest.  I had done several summer quests as a kid myself, as you probably have too.  It’s time to use what summer you have left to get your kids outside on their own adventures. One of my summer quests was what I’ll call The Quest For the Six Pack Of Coke.  My parents did not buy soda, so once when I wanted some Coca-cola (about age 8), I had to get it myself.  First I had to earn the $ 1.00 it cost.  I went around the neighborhood drumming up jobs, and after raking grass and pulling weeds I had four shiny quarters. Then I had to plan the bike ride, an all afternoon trek to the supermarket and back. It became a sunny day ride through seldom-traveled neighborhoods that seemed like foreign lands. Like all quests it was more about the journey than the destination. Send your kids on their own quests.  Half the journey is the planning, and you can help  with that: bicycle maintenance, planning routes to balance safety and adventure, and the road home.  Instead of a six pack of soda, the quest can be a specialty store like one that makes in-house chocolates, or similar exotic destinations. There’s a modern version of the scavenger hunt called Geocaching, where fellow scavengers have hidden little prizes all over the country. Look up online how to go find the prizes, in parks and neighborhoods, and join your kids on a ready-made adventure. Another version of the Quest is the Excursion, where your family visits a familiar destination like the library or grocery store.  But instead of driving there, you walk or bike. Again, half the fun is the planning:  what route to take, where to stop for ice cream and drinks, carrying groceries, managing heat and mosquitoes.  You’ll need water, hats or bike helmets, bug spray.  Then adventure happens when you find yourself in places that look familiar when whizzing by your car window, but are totally new when you walk or bike them. So save summer from boredom and the computers.  Send your kids on a Quest or take them on an Excursion.  Or closer to home, help them find The Ghost In The Graveyard. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Teens Behind The Wheel!  Look out! Posted on August 15, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply My three teens may not believe it, but I also once was a teen.  And one night I was bombing down a snowy road in our old iron Jeep Cherokee, the radio blasting my rock station, not a care in the world.  Then I topped a hill and headed down.  Now, four-wheel-drive is fine for getting you started on slippery ice and snow, but it’s no help slowing you down.  And down I went, at speed. The hill had a turn and when I put on the brakes, I started sliding out of control towards some trees. So I pumped the brakes as best I could, made the turn, and headed for the intersection at the bottom.  Unable to stop, I hung on and hoped for the best.  Just before I crossed that road, a Honda Civic zipped by. Luckily that was it for traffic.  I skidded across and came bumping to a stop on a snow-covered lawn.  After a few minutes I was able to quit shaking and drive away. My wintery adventure illustrates some safety issues with teen drivers.  Teens are inexperienced drivers.  They haven’t had enough time on the road to learn things like braking in time or driving slow enough for road conditions.  Teenagers also like speed. Speeding is fun, even though it’s not safe.  Teens don’t think about consequences. They’re temporary sociopaths- who cares about the future, I’m all about here and now. Though I had driven and jogged over that hill thousands of times, I didn’t foresee going over in a heavy car on snow. Teens are also easily distracted behind the wheel. Like teen me, they listen to the radio too loud.  They drive with friends and have intensely important conversations, or a lot of laughs.  They talk on phones.  They text.  These things take a teen’s eyes and mind off what is out front.  Another car slams on the brakes, a red light is ignored, a turn is too tight, disaster ensues. The above safety issues with teen drivers are why their car insurance is so expensive. Teenagers crash- they incur car repair bills and medical expenses.  So what can we do to keep our teens safer while they gain experience behind the wheel?  Fortunately Louisiana has Graduated Driver Licensing. This system allows teens to gain experience while keeping them, and those driving around them, safer. The first rule in GDL is when a teen gets a permit at age 15, they must drive at least 50 hours before they get their license.  This means they should spend about one full hour per week driving with an adult, hopefully more.  15 of those hours should be gaining experience driving at night.  When a teen gets licensed at 16, there are more rules for that first year of solo driving.  By Louisiana law, no driving after 11 pm.  Teens can’t have passengers after 6 pm, except an adult over 21.  They can’t use cell phones.  And no texting. Ever. Even after 17. Here are some ideas to keep your teen driver even safer. First, try to delay when they start driving.  The older teens get the more their brains mature, and they become safer drivers. Take advantage of teen procrastination.  Don’t drive them to the Office of Motor Vehicles on their 15th birthday- let them decide when to go in their own good time. Wait for them to badger you incessantly before you (eventually) get around to bringing them. Before you go, make them look up what they will need to bring to get their permit, and get those things themselves- this alone will buy you another few weeks of brain maturity. Also, wait another year or two after 17 before you let them drive with friends or with a phone, or with the radio on.  More time driving with good concentration will help form better driving habits.  Finally, limit the time they drive in the rain, on the highway, at night, or at rush hour.  They do need to get experienced driving in adversity, but take it slow. I’ve got three teens on the road myself and followed these rules and my wife and I still worry at night.  Look out!  Teens on the road! Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Call Poison Control!  1-800-222-1222 Posted on May 16, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply One of my favorite movies is a 1991 comedy called Defending Your Life, starring Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep.  The premise is when someone dies, before going to heaven he must defend his life in a trial with lawyers and judge. The evidence presented is scenes from the deceased’s life.  At one point for fun the prosecutor shows scenes of Albert Brooks just being stupid.  He shows the character in the bathroom picking up shampoo instead of mouthwash, taking a swig, and then spewing shampoo all over. A similar goof happened to two kids last month.  They picked up hydrocortisone cream instead of toothpaste while brushing.  They started brushing with the cream and I am sure re-enacted Albert Brooks.  I found this pretty funny, because I KNOW brushing with hydrocortisone is harmless.  The two moms didn’t know this.  One mom called Poison Control, who told her that this was perfectly safe and she could stay home.  The other mom didn’t call and came to the Emergency Department, waited an hour to get seen, to have me say her kid was fine. So here are things that I have seen kids, usually those pesky exploring toddlers, eat that are perfectly harmless.  Shampoo and hydrocortisone cream, of course.  Sugar ants (had invaded a restaurant’s soda machine and mom found them floating in her daughter’s drink).  Poinsetta leaves (turns out that these are only mildly irritating on contact, maybe leading to some brief vomiting and diarrhea at worst).  Ibuprofen (brand names Motrin or Advil). Here are some things kids drink that are USUALLY harmless in small doses. One of the most common toddler ingestions is household bleach.  A few teaspoons is harmless, which is usually all they can stand before gagging and spitting.  Tylenol, Aspirin, and ADHD medications are also okay in small amounts. Call Poison Control to be sure.  They can help you decide if your child needs to be seen. If your child should be checked out, Poison Control calls the Emergency Department to alert us you are coming. Occasionally a child poisoning is not as goofy as those kids from above who brushed their teeth with hydrocortisone.  Once police were called to a house where the parents were fist fighting.  When the officers entered they found a 3 year-old boy lying unconscious among empty pill and liquor bottles.  When the child got to us he was breathing but unarousable. We tested the boy for everything we could- brain bleeding, alcohol poisoning, narcotics, etc.  All the tests came up negative, but there are many medicines we do not have tests for (real life is not like CSI:Miami). There was a grandmother in the house also, who took eight medicines. Worried that the child took one of those, we reviewed the list with Poison Control.  Four of the drugs could have made this kid like he was.  We admitted him for observation and fortunately he woke up the next morning and was fine. What kinds of grandma medicines could have done this?  Many adults take blood pressure medicines, heart medicines, and diabetes pills.  All these can hurt kids.  Other dangerous medicines include antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and narcotic pain medications. Believe it or not, one of the most dangerous medications a toddler can take is adult iron pills.  Keep all these medicines where small children absolutely cannot get them!  Elderly people often organize their many pills in plastic daily dispensers; if the grandkids are around and granddad leaves it out, that’s big trouble waiting to happen.  Toddlers who see granddad pop his pills will imitate him and do the same. Finally, do not leave fuels like gasoline and kerosene around in cups.  To a toddler, a cup is an invitation to drink.  They don’t understand the difference if that cup was filled with old lawnmower gas or juice.  Be just as careful with drain cleaners like Drano or Liquid Fire- these can be deadly too. Again, when in doubt call Poison Control.  They can tell you if you need to come in, or stay home and not wait in Emergency for me to tell you: brushing with hydrocortisone is pretty funny, and safe. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply The Ugly Truth About the Runs Posted on April 4, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Eric Guilbeau, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Emma comes home from school and tells her mom that her belly hurts and she doesn’t feel good.  Mom tells here to lie down and rest and she will feel better.  About 30 minutes later Emma yells for mommy!  When mom walks in she finds vomit in the bed, all over the pillow and sheets.  Mom grabs Emma and runs to the bathroom where Emma starts to vomit again, now with diarrhea.  After a day or two mom brings Emma to the Emergency Department because Emma has no energy and cannot eat or drink.  Emma is diagnosed with Gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is commonly known as “the stomach bug,” “stomach virus,” or even more simply “virus.”  Sometimes people use “rotavirus” to mean all vomiting and diarrhea viruses, though rotavirus is just one of many viruses that cause these symptoms.  Viruses are microscopic chemical machines that invade the body.  They enter the body by the mouth through contaminated food or when the victim puts a contaminated hand in the mouth.  The viruses burrow into the body’s cells, take the cells over, and start the fun. The signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis start about 1 to 3 days after the virus enters the body.  It takes that long, what we call the “incubation period,” for the virus to spread and take over enough of your stomach and intestines to start the symptoms.  Thus if Emma touched an infected doorknob at school on Thursday and a few minutes later played with her lip, she could expect to start acting sick by Friday or Saturday. What can Emma then expect?  Watery diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, fever, headache, and fatigue.  Usually kids will vomit for the first half-day, then have diarrhea for a few days more.  However, it can be normal for symptoms to last 7 to 10 days!  Parents should seek help when the child has lots of pain, bloody diarrhea, or is dehydrated.  Parents should watch for worsening pain, increasing sleepiness, no urine for 12 hours, dry mouth, sunken eyes, no tears when crying. Sometimes when we tell a parent a diagnosis like Gastroenteritis, the parent gives us a skeptical look.  How can we know just by looking- shouldn’t we run some tests?  Well, the vast majority of illnesses are diagnosed from the medical “history.”  The history is simply the story of your child’s illness.  When did he start getting sick?  How much did he vomit and have diarrhea?  Was he around other sick kids or family?  How is he acting now?  Is he making urine?  Then the doctor uses the physical exam to confirm what she thinks is the diagnosis, and further assess for signs of dehydration or more serious illness- dried out mouth, decreased circulation, tender stomach, patient responsiveness.  Tests are only necessary if the doctor is concerned about serious dehydration or a more serious illness that is masquerading as gastroenteritis, like appendicitis. How is gastroenteritis treated?  The most important management is preventing dehydration.  Most gastroenteritis is mild and can be treated at home: pedialyte and breast feeding for infants, dilute juices or sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade (Gatorade G2 is particularly good) for older kids.  If your child cannot stop vomiting or has worsening dehydration, she might need IV fluids. Here are some home instructions for parents:  After the child stops vomiting, feed with only clear fluids as above for six to eight hours.  This lets the stomach settle before trying solid foods.  Ease back into eating after about 6 to 8 hours of the fluids; the stomach may not be ready for food or milk before then.  Avoid fatty or seasoned foods and let your child get plenty of rest.  The first two days of vomiting and diarrhea are not good times to rush your child back to school. Most importantly, teach your kids to prevent getting Gastroenteritis.  Teach them to wash their hands after using the bathroom and before eating.  Teach them not to put their hands in their mouth so much. When they do get sick, keep them home for to rest from school. Loving care at home is the best medicine. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Ah Choo!  My Child Always Has A Cold! Posted on March 3, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s column is from Dr. Susila Shanmuganathan, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Another runny nose?  Don’t they know this is an Emergency Department, and cold viruses are hardly an emergency?  When we finally interview mom though, her frustration comes through.  Her child has been sneezing, rubbing her eyes and face for weeks, and mom is fed up.  The kid coughs all night and none of the cold remedies have touched it.  Maybe its not just a virus that should have gone away weeks ago. Does your little one always have the sniffles?  Is she constantly rubbing her eyes and wiping her nose?  Your child may have Allergic Rhinitis, also known as seasonal allergies or hay fever. Allergic rhinitis is a common problem in infants and children.  The symptoms can vary, the most common being a clear runny nose, sneezing, and itchy red eyes.  Kids may have dark circles under their eyes (“allergic shiners”) or a crease across their nasal bridge caused by constantly wiping their noses upwards (the “allergic salute”).   Children may also have a cough that is worse at night.  These symptoms are often worse at certain times of the year when there are more pollens and other allergens in the air.  Some people have allergies to year-round, indoor allergens like dust, pets, and molds. So what the heck is an “allergen?”  What is pollen exactly?  Allergens and pollen are tiny bits of plants or animals that are so small they cannot be seen.  Often they are so small and light that they float through the air.  When they get up some kids’ noses or in their eyes or in their lungs, the kids’ immune systems react against the allergens and try to flush them out. The body makes extra mucus and tears to wash them away.  The body also makes sneezing and coughing to blow the allergens out. Allergies can be a real burden.  All that itching and sneezing and coughing- it really irritates. It’s harder to play, it’s harder to pay attention in school, it’s harder to sleep- life is a lot less fun!  So what can you do to control these symptoms?  First, there is no need to get frazzled.  There are some simple things you can try at home before visiting your doctor or allergist.  The easiest thing is to avoid exposure to allergens that seem to make your kid worse- pets, dusty areas, certain plants.  Look for weather reports with pollen counts. If the day’s pollen counts will be high, avoid outdoor activities. For medicines, you can start with an over-the-counter antihistamine like loratidine (Claritin) or cetirizine (Zyrtec).  Though you can use these medications on an “as needed” basis, it may actually be nicer for your child to use them every day so you don’t end up chasing symptoms.  It’s best to start these medicines right before your child’s allergy season and use them every day throughout that season.  As stated before though, some kids have year-round allergies and need to be on medicine every day all year. If your kid needs better medicine than those, see your doctor about nasal steroids such as Nasonex, Flonase, or Nasacort.  They are a little more trouble to use, but they work better than the antihistamine syrups.  If those don’t cut it, then it is time for allergy testing to better find out what allergens to avoid.  Your child may need more medicine, or allergy shots. Many parents worry that their child won’t tolerate getting an injection every week.  It’s a judgement call between the parent and the allergist: sometimes the shots are a whole lot better than living with constant itching and sneezing and sleep deprivation. But remember, there are simple things you can do at home and symptoms to look for before you worry and head to your doctor or the ER.  Avoid the pet dander and pollen.  Try the first-line antihistamines.  Although our kids might love animals and the outdoors, sometimes it may take their breath away…Ah choo!

Posted on February 13, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply My blog has moved to a new home.  Entries from my old blog came over, and can be found in the archive in the column to the right of this page.  As before, my emphasis is to help you understand what is an emergency, and what is not.  Too many parents bring their kids to an emergency room for things that are not emergencies.  Hopefully reading some of my columns will help you take care of your sick or injured child at home. Please feel free to comment on what I have to say, ask questions, or add your own stories.  As before though, I can not give advice on individual patients- that is your own doctor’s job! Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Belly Pain- Is it an Appendix? Posted on February 2, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply A common reason for parents to bring their kids to the ED is belly pain.  Doctor’s offices and “quick care” urgent care clinics also send us a lot of kids with belly pain.  Everyone has the same  basic concern- is it appendicitis?  Does the child need an operation? I often encourage families to stay home or wait to see their doctor for things that are obviously not emergencies.  Runny noses, fevers, diarrhea, rashes, even ear pain- Stay home!  Give ibuprofen!  Belly pain, though, should not be waited on very long.  Belly pain lasting more than a few hours needs to be discussed with a doctor, first on the phone, and then in the office or E.D. What is appendicitis?  The appendix is a tiny pouch that usually hangs off your intestines in your right lower side.  Appendicitis is when poop gets trapped in the appendix, gets infected, and the appendix slowly swells like a boil.  With swelling and infection comes pain, fever, and nausea.  A “ruptured” appendix is when the appendix bursts and the pus and infection spread throughout the abdomen.  We always hope to diagnose appendicitis and get it out before rupture, but that is sometimes just not possible. Though most belly pains turn out to be stomach virus or constipation, the diagnosis of appendicitis can be tricky.   Early on appendicitis can act like stomach virus and fool the doctor.  Sometimes the child is admitted to the hospital, the doctors and surgeons debate and ponder, and finally days later the surgeon decides to take the patient to surgery for the pain.  Only then, with the patient opened up, does the surgeon look in and go “ah-ha” and make the diagnosis. With belly pain, first call your doctor.  Some doctors are comfortable making the diagnosis in the office and then sending the patient right to a surgeon.  Some refer the family to the ED for diagnosis.  Make sure you take your child to a hospital that cares for children and has surgeons available.  In Lafayette, that is Lafayette General Medical Center and usually Women’s and Children’s Hospital too. What does a child with appendicitis look like?  First, the pain starts as a steady, slowly worsening pain.  Often the pain starts in the middle of the belly, under the belly  button, and later is more in the right lower side.  Kids with appendicitis lose their appetite and sometimes vomit later in the illness.  They also often have later fevers.  This is usually unlike stomach virus, where kids vomit first, have early fevers, and have crampy belly pain that comes and goes away. At the hospital, the ED doctor and surgeon often make the diagnosis and decide on surgery by just taking a history (hearing the “story” of the illness) and examining the child.  Few tests are needed besides a few blood tests.  CT scanning is usually unnecessary.  One estimate is that only 10% of appendicitis cases need a CT to make the diagnosis.  CT adds a lot of radiation exposure, and sometimes can miss an appendicitis or mislead the doctors with extraneous information. The surgery itself is usually uncomplicated and safe, as long as the appendix hasn’t ruptured.  The child often goes home in a day or two after surgery.  If the appendix has ruptured, that means recovery takes a week or two of antibiotics and care in the hospital. So if your child has belly pain, but is walking, smiling, eating and the pain goes away soon, it probably is not appendicitis.  If he or she starts with pain that is steady and worsening over some hours, come on in! Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Picking A Doctor For Your Child Posted on February 2, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply Every day several families bring their kids in to the Emergency Department with non-emergencies- runny noses, rashes, diarrhea.  Then many times the mom, perhaps sensing our impatience with the inappropriateness of that visit, state “I called my doctor and they were too booked, and told me to come here.”  Or worse, they might say “I don’t have a doctor for my child.” Having your own doctor for your child is important.  You know you have a doctor who cares, and listens.  That doctor knows your child too, and has all the child’s past history at their fingertips.  You have a place to go for check-ups, sports physicals, shots, and questions.  If you go to an Emergency Department or quick-care clinic, its pot luck.  Maybe the doctor will care and listen well, maybe not.  Maybe they know kids, maybe not.  They certainly won’t know your child well. What if you are a new parent, or new in town?  Or what if you want to change doctors?  Here are the things that help you find a good doctor for your kid: 1.  The doctor is “Board-Certified” in Pediatrics or Family Medicine-  The national boards only certify doctors who have demonstrated through testing and credentials that they are keeping up-to-date in their field. 2.  Full-time Practice- It is important that your doctor, or covering partners, are available as much as possible.  The best practices have evening and weekend hours for working parents.  And of course, the practice should have doctors with around-the-clock phone availability in case of emergencies. 3.  Reputation- it is nice that people you know recommend a doctor, but a bad comment doesn’t necessarily mean the doctor is bad.  Even the best doctor can’t please everyone all of the time.   However, recommendations from other doctors carry a lot of weight.  Doctors work with each other all of the time and know who are the hot-shots and who are the slackers. 4.  Fellows of the American Academy of Pediatrics or American Academy of Family Physicians-  These doctors will have the initials after their name FAAP or FAAFP, as in Scott Hamilton, MD, FAAP.  This designation is icing on the cake of Board Certification.  This means that the doctor is a member of the national professional organization that provides the most up-to-date information in their field.  The AAP and AAFP work with the national boards to develop practice standards.  The AAP and AAFP also are active politically to help governments in the United States and abroad provide the best care for children. 5.  The doctor is a good listener- as I have stated elsewhere in this blog, most diagnoses are made from the patient’s story, so your doctor needs to be a good listener to be a good doctor.   There is an old adage that you would rather have a mean doctor that knows the latest cures than a nice, hand-holding doctor that will kill you through incompetence.  In truth, wouldn’t you rather have both?  Professionalism demands that doctors be both good and kind listeners, and up-to-date in their practice. These days, with blitzes of advertising of doctors, clinics, and hospitals, these are the hints that can help you find a good medical home for your child’s care.

Posted on November 15, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Yamuna Jaladanki, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. The other day in the ER I saw two kids from the same family, one 11 months old and the other 9 years old.  Mother told me that one had fever, the other fatigue.  Mom also mentioned that one of her other children was tested positive for the flu.  Since both children were exposed to their sibling, we tested them for flu too.  Both were positive.  The whole family was in for a week of misery. It’s that time of year when lots of parents bring their kids to Emergency Departments or Urgent Care Centers with complaints of fever.  Most of the time of the child has common cold or another 2 to 3 day virus.  But sometimes it is the flu.  You and many parents may wonder- what exactly is the flu?  Why is it in the news so much?  Why are we being constantly bothered to get the flu vaccine? What is the flu? People use the word “flu” for many illnesses.  Some say “stomach flu” when they mean a vomiting and diarrhea virus.  Some use “flu” to describe a cough/runny nose/fever virus.  But we in medicine use “flu” as a short word for Influenza, a particularly nasty virus with some special properties. Influenza is a virus that gives its victim fever, and feelings of feverishness and chills.  Kids with flu often have cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and feeling tired.  Some kids may have vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, body aches, and blood-shot eyes. Why is flu so important? Most of the time kids who have flu have mild illness.  Some children are more prone to develop serious complications, like pneumonia, which can sometimes even be fatal.  These are children with asthma, heart problems, or neurological conditions.  For this reason, any child older than six months and people living around children should be vaccinated. Why do we all need the vaccine?  Is it that contagious? Yes, flu is highly contagious, meaning it is easily and quickly spread from person to person. Droplets of cough, sneeze, or even from talking can spread the flu virus from one child or adult to another.  Also touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching one’s own mouth, eyes, or nose can transmit the virus.  Another bad thing about contagiousness is that a person infected can spread the flu one day before symptoms develop.  This means an infected person can be passing the virus around even before he or she knows they have it! What is the normal course of Influenza? This is another nasty thing about the flu- the misery can last a long time, from 5 days to 2 weeks.  Most recover in one to two weeks. What are the serious complications of the flu? Influenza can lead to some bad complications, particularly in vulnerable kids like those with asthma.  These complications include bacterial pneumonia (serious infection of the lung), ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of asthma or heart problems or diabetes. How do you test for flu and treat it? We test for the flu by swabbing for mucus from the child’s nose.  If the kid tests positive, this is one of the few viruses that there are medicines to help, like Tamiflu or Relenza.  They can make the symptoms go away sooner and make the patient less contagious.  But the treatment must be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms to help- after that, the medicine won’t help. Another important treatment is fluids.  Kids can become dehydrated from fever and from feeling so bad that they just don’t want to drink.  Some kids also vomit and have diarrhea with the flu.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol can help your child feel better enough to drink.  Also, your doctor can prescribe medicine for the nausea and vomiting. So get you and your kids their influenza vaccine.  Get vaccinated each season, since the virus changes a little each year and new vaccine is needed to keep up.  You can not catch Influenza from the vaccine, but you really can catch it easily from the rest of the world.

It’s stressful to be sure; it’s supposed to be tough.  Some girls are fainting, some are washing out because they can’t hack it, some stay up too late and lose sleep. Amy has her eyes on the prize- graduating and moving up.  When she gets anxious, she swallows it and moves on. Uncharacteristic for her, she’s eating well and going to bed early.  Her parents are proud, not only for her accomplishment but for how far Amy has come.  Her life wasn’t always this way. From an early age, Amy was having a rough go.  She had trouble paying attention in first grade, though she was highly intelligent.  She angered some teachers with her pointed, seemingly rude commentaries, though other teachers “got” her. She was tried on ADHD medications, which helped for a time, but then began causing side effects where Amy acted confused and panicky.  By high school, it was clear Amy was depressed.  She was sullen, didn’t get along with most of her classmates, and scraped out poor grades. Despite grasping the material, she just didn’t care enough to get papers in on time or study for tests. Amy had no obvious reason for depression.  She had two loving, educated parents and two happy siblings.  At the first sign of trouble with attention or mood, she got the best doctors and therapists.  As Amy got older and was able to verbalize what was going on inside, it seemed her depression was “chemical:”  she was just born that way, with no external reasons like bullying or her looks. Anti-depressant medication helped, as did continued counseling.  Her parents cheered her on through thick and thin, and as she got older Amy’s life began looking up.  College was much better than high school as far as academics and having friends. She had positive dreams for her future.  Joining the Army wasn’t her parents first choice; heck, even with a bachelor’s degree she enlisted rather than take on the responsibility of being an officer. But now they were singing a different tune. Sharon has it much worse than Amy.  I saw Sharon in the Emergency Department last month.  She came by ambulance after being beaten by a gang of boys.  They ran up behind her, knocked her down, and kicked her repeatedly in the head and chest. There had apparently been some bad blood between Sharon’s friends and other factions in the neighborhood. From our computer record I saw that Sharon had had a tough life already, though only 15 years-old. She had been seen by us twice for sexual assaults, another time for being beaten up, and once to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal thoughts. She came from a rough house in a rough neighborhood.  Her mom obviously had mental illness of her own, from the pressured speech of hyperactivity or drug use, to her peculiar tattoos.  Mom yelled a lot, at Sharon and us, though this seemed to be not from anger but how she usually spoke. Certainly Sharon’s depression has not gotten the attention that Amy’s did.  Though she had been in hospital for depression, Sharon isn’t on anti-depressants and isn’t in counseling.  Chaos rules her home life: her father’s gone, and she bounces between mom’s and the homes of several other families. Her school and neighborhood aren’t safe. Despite all this, I have some hope for Sharon.  Kids can be resilient, and Sharon still had an occasional smile and some spunk, despite what just happened.  Mom also did seem to care about her, as did an aunt with her who seemed more emotionally stable.  They agreed that counseling was a good idea, and to see her doctor about a psychiatric referral. Some kids like Amy are born with depression.  Some like Sharon, besides having inborn depression, also have life stresses that contribute.  Both kids need attention- counseling and maybe medicine to get them through bad patches. If your kid seems depressed, telling them to buck up and act happier isn’t enough.  You should ask about suicidal thoughts, why he is depressed, and see his doctor.  Depression is rough, so better that your kid gets the attention that Amy got, rather than Sharon’s. Posted in Depression , Talking with Teenagers , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply The Mumps Is Not A Muppet Posted on January 13, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Rati Venkatesh, a Family Practice resident at University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. This winter we’ve seen nearby outbreaks of Mumps in Arkansas and Texas.  Last week a mother brought her 3 year-old daughter into the Emergency Department worried about just that.  The girl had fever and headache and mom had just heard the news.  Instead the girl turned out to have influenza virus, which causes many of the same symptoms.  But this raised the question: what exactly is the Mumps? Though it sounds like a muppet character, the mumps is an illness caused by a highly contagious virus.  The classic sign of mumps is swollen parotid glands, which are glands at the back of your cheeks.  When they swell you look like a chipmunk. Mumps usually starts with fever, headache, and maybe vomiting.  Symptoms also include cough, runny nose, poor appetite, muscle aches, and generally feeling run down.  Sure sounds like the flu- no wonder that mom was worried! The biggest concern about mumps is that in rare cases it can cause encephalitis, or brain infection and swelling.  In teenagers and adults, it can also cause exquisitely painful swelling of testicles or ovaries.  Before the mumps vaccine was invented in 1967, people were understandably scared of this disease. Now with the MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella) vaccine, mumps has mostly passed into history books, except for the occasional case. If there is a nearby outbreak, what do you do?  First, speak to your doctor.  If your child has concerning symptoms, she can order the mumps blood test.  A big clue to whether your child has the mumps is exposure- was your child around someone with mumps? Figuring this out can be tricky, because it can be weeks after exposure before you begin to have symptoms.  Who remembers where they were two weeks ago- it’s tough enough remembering what you had for lunch yesterday!  So usually when it comes to the individual kid, we count on the classic chipmunk-cheeks to make the diagnosis. How do you get the mumps anyway? Transmission is by respiratory droplets, which means an infected kid coughs and sneezes, or wipes his slimy hands, on his playmates.  The new victims stick those virus-laden droplets on their fingers, into their noses and mouths. So to prevent mumps, kids should do the things to prevent catching other infectious diseases, like colds and stomach viruses: they should wash their hands.  Frequent hand-washing should be taught and encouraged at home and school.  Hand sanitizer dispensers are readily available in public places, and are a reasonable substitute.  I teach kids to wash hands to the Happy Birthday song- if you wash all surfaces of your hands using the amount of time it takes to sing the song, you’ve done a great job of disinfecting. Also use disinfectant wipes to clean household and school surfaces.  Those respiratory droplets and their viruses can linger on tables and doorknobs, and contaminate unsuspecting hands that touch them later.  Teach your kids to cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbows- this keeps grubby hands from infecting surfaces too. If your child gets the mumps, the only treatment is for symptoms- there’s no medicine to make it go away quicker.  Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen for pain and fever.  The chipmunk cheeks or swollen testicles of mumps can really hurt, so don’t skimp on those medicines!  Ice packs can also soothe these sensitive parts.  Most kids and adults get over mumps in about 2 weeks.  Occasionally children need hospitalization for pain control or IV fluids.  If they get encephalitis, they’ll need intensive care to control brain swelling. Vaccination is great protection against mumps.  Kids get their first MMR shot at 12 months-old, and the second before kindergarten.  This vaccine is very safe, much safer than the car ride to the doctor’s to get it!  Some get a mild fever a week after vaccination, but serious complications are quite rare.  Like any vaccine, your child is incredibly more likely to catch and be harmed by mumps, than be harmed by the vaccine. So all concerned moms and dads out there, if your child has flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, headache, fatigue) with swollen cheeks, it might be the mumps!  See your doctor for testing.  But with vaccination, odds are you won’t ever be in this worrisome place.

His fellow millennials were lamenting that 2016 was the worst year ever: “David Bowie and Prince died!” My son’s response: “Worst year ever?  What about 1939?”  Nazis starting World War II was a lot worse than some celebrities passing away. As a pediatrician, I saw many good things about 2016. While preparing for my yearly mission trip to Honduras, I’m reminded of positives for even the most impoverished U.S. citizens- clean water, with no risk of cholera.  And while some American kids go hungry, there isn’t the abject starvation of the third world. Though we worry about the environmental impact of coal, oil production, and car exhaust, we enjoy pretty clean air compared to the third world.  Their vehicles and factories have unregulated emissions, families cook inside over open fires, and farms often practice slash-and-burn techniques. In fact, Americans suffer from too many good things.  Too much food and too much sitting around looking at screens leads to obesity.  2016 has highlighted another rising glut- too much information.  T he recent presidential race has revealed growing anxiety about which information is real, which is made up.  Is this candidate telling the truth?  Where are they getting their facts?  What are the facts, and where to find them? There was a recent political cartoon depicting two people looking at cellphones, wondering if the news they were reading was real or fake, and how they could find out. Standing behind them was a newspaper stand.  A subtext of the joke is that many no longer trust information from traditional sources, like newspaper and TV media, government, or science.  Too many conspiracy theories, too many scandals, have undermined faith in these traditional institutions. As a doctor, my decision-making relies on good data.  It’s a professional duty to find facts for the good of the patient. Newspaper and TV media and government scientists are the same.  The vast majority of journalists and scientists are professionals, diligent about getting facts right.  You can trust them for the best information, better than random websites. When looking for medical information, like about vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control or the American Academy of Pediatrics, rather than some un-credentialed crank. Besides cataloging the year’s best and worst, a favorite new year pastime is making New Year’s Resolutions.  I’m not big on resolutions myself. Doctors have to continually make new good habits and throw out old ones, as medical knowledge evolves. Nothing’s special about New Year’s when it comes to medical innovation. I don’t encourage New Year’s resolutions in others either, as humorist Dave Barry wrote, “so that you can become a better you- a more-attractive you, an organized you, a you that is…well, less like you.”  This column is always about making good habits all year, throughout your childrens’ growing-up, so they are safer and happier. Good habits aren’t actually hard to make when there’s quick results. New Year’s resolutions, the good habits that we continually fail to make, are the ones that require persistence to get to the pay-off.  Losing weight or exercising are commonly failed resolutions because it’s months before you look or feel better, while you suffer through cravings and pain.  Quick pay-off habits, like always putting your car keys in your left pocket so you never lose them, are easy to develop. Here’s an easy habit to keep your kids happy, healthy, and safe: get them a doctor and dentist.  Many kids I see in the Emergency Department don’t have these. Some kids don’t get sick much, so their parents stopped taking them for yearly check-ups. When the kids do get sick, they get taken to a walk-in clinic or ER. However, doctor and dentist practices help you keep good habits.  At yearly check-ups, they discuss how to keep your kids well, appropriate to their age and development.  If your kid’s a toddler, they discuss tooth-brushing and toddler-proofing the house.  For teenagers, it’s about acne, wearing seat belts, and not getting pregnant. My dentist’s office books my next appointment before I leave.  Six months later I get two phone calls to remind me when to come. That’s a slick outfit- they keep their patients coming in, and my my teeth stay clean.  Get your kids a dentist and doctor with such a well-run office.  They’ll do your New Year’s resolution work for you. Posted in Uncategorized | Leave a reply Forever Seared Into My Memory Posted on December 16, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Aaron Foster, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Forever seared into my memory is the image of my friend, running down the dock at summer camp, his body engulfed in flames.  Behind him trailed burning footprints, lighting his path in the night.  All boys are fascinated by fire, and at age 14 we discovered that aerosol bug spray was flammable, and would briefly burn on your skin without causing injury.  This led to the scene of my friend, doused in flaming insect repellent, running down the dock to jump in the lake.  Luckily he survived the ordeal unharmed, minus some hairs on his head and eyebrows. Many children, though not as foolish as we were, are not as lucky either.  According to National Institutes of Health (NIH) statistics, a quarter of all burns treated in the U.S. involve kids under age 16.  While teenage foolishness may be unavoidable, burns are largely preventable.  The incidence of burns, and most importantly severe burns, has decreased in recent decades.  This is due to improved building codes, education in schools about fire escape planning, and smoke detectors.  Yet burns do still occur, and fortunately most of these are minor. As a medical student I spent time on a burn ward, and saw many different types and severities of burns.  One thing that stood out for me was the disproportionate number of young children admitted for burns.  According to the NIH, most pediatric burns happen to kids under age 5.  Most of these are scald injuries, and occur in the kitchen.  And given that we adults are in charge of the kitchen, these are avoidable. Preventing burns includes common sense things like keeping small children out of the kitchen while cooking.  Don’t carry children and hot food at the same time.  Advice that might seem less obvious: turn the pot handles on the stove inward, so they don’t stick out where kids can grab them.  Make sure appliance cords don’t hang over counters either, for the same reason- curious children grab stuff, and if that stuff is hot toasters or pots full of boiling soup, disaster can ensue. Several times in the past in this blog, Dr. Hamilton has mentioned that most of the burns he sees are when little kids take hot bowls of noodles out of microwaves.  Someone else happens along, bumps that big, in-the-way microwave door, and the bowl spills on the child.  In my time as a medical student on the burn ward, I also saw a lot of kids burned when they pulled on a tablecloth that had a container of hot liquid on top. As we mentioned above, kitchen burns can be prevented with a little extra care.  Small children should be kept out of the kitchen while hot food is being prepared, and should never operate microwave ovens without an adult hovering.  Pot handles and electric cords should be out of reach. After age 5, burns happen more with open flames.  This includes campfires and bonfires, and fireworks.  Open fires should be contained within fire pits, with no flammables (extra wood, long dry grasses) close by.  Kids shouldn’t wear loose flowing clothing near fire, or clothes that easily catch fire with a spark (synthetics).  And though it seems obvious (to the sober), don’t throw lighter fluid or gasoline on open flames.  We see too many kids who get engulfed when those fluids become an exploding cloud. Though we do our best to prevent children from harming themselves, burns happen. Fortunately the vast majority do not require seeing a doctor.  Small burns can be managed at home by remembering the 5 C’s.  Clothing- immediately remove any clothing involved, so that the hot liquid or flaming clothes don’t continue to burn. Cooling- cool water stops the burning process, and feels good too!  Cleaning- soap and water is sufficient, to minimize infection if the skin barrier is compromised.  Cover- put on antibiotic ointment generously and cover with gauze.  This also soothes, and prevents infection. Comfort- pain relief with Tylenol or ibuprofen. When should kids see a doctor for burns?  Burns that blister, or are larger than the area of the patient’s hand, or involve faces or joints, should get seen.  Kids should have up-to-date tetanus vaccines, since burns increase the risk of tetanus infection. Posted in burns | Leave a reply ‘Twas The Night Before Christmas- AAUGH! Posted on December 2, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, Christmas is only slightly safer for kids than riding bikes no hands, eyes closed, on the roof.  The AAP website has a three page list on avoiding flaming disaster in the living room.  To be fair, their are some extra hazards in the season.  However, my experience in Pediatric Emergency is less about Ralphie shooting out his eye with a Red Rider B.B. Gun, and more about toddlers chewing Christmas tree light bulbs. Toddlers love putting brightly colored, shiny objects in their mouths.  Decorative light bulbs have thin glass, easily cracked when bitten. Fortunately, the curious kids get only a few minor cuts in their mouths and quickly heal. Occasionally we see more traumatic ingestions when toddlers get a tiny bit of Christmas lodged in their airway or esophagus and need surgery for removal. No matter how well your house is toddler-proofed, with cabinets locked and choking hazards swept away, Christmas undoes all that.  It’s impossible to police boxes of decorations, toys with tiny pieces, things hanging off Christmas tree branches. Thus one more holiday stress: having to watch your cruising babies extra carefully with all that stuff around.  Best advice: keep decoration ambitions small and manageable. The next realistic Christmas safety worry is kids and dogs.  Kids and dogs interact more during the holidays, either with new dogs as presents, or visiting friends and relatives with dogs.  Trouble starts when kids want to meet the pooch, poochie gets nervous about approaching strangers, and bites them in the face. Best advice: don’t get a new dog until your children are 5 years-old, when they can learn to treat animals safely. Closely supervise interactions between your child and others’ pets. Fires are another seasonal worry.  The Christmas tree tradition started in Germany, with candles on them for illumination.  My dad lived there in the 1950s and told of proud Germans who eschewed electric bulbs for old-fashioned candles, and the busy Fire Brigades racing from one tragic house fire to another.  Even with electric bulbs, trees fires are possible. Trees dry out easily, are covered with flammable ornaments, kindled with paper wrapped gifts, and stand next to overloaded power sockets.  Keep tree water filled, and unplug lights overnight. Besides physical risks for kids at Christmas, the season is emotionally stressful. Parents get overwhelmed, and kids too.  We’re looking for Peace On Earth and Good Will among men, yet find ourselves cutting each other off for parking spaces at the mall. One source of stress is that during Christmas we are supposed to be happy, and are disappointed when the season isn’t any happier than usual.  The disappointment is even more acute when we become less happy due to seasonal hassles. The list of things that drag on us at Christmas continues: overeating, driving through traffic to shop in mad crowds, dragging decorations out, extra cooking.  And while visiting family is usually a good time, you also visit some you don’t like (you moved so far away for a reason). Kids get stressed too. They overeat, and eat too many things that cause stomach-aches. They stay up too late, and are exhausted the next day.  They get sick- it’s the cold and flu season after all.  And parents aren’t paying them enough attention because we’re too busy on a regular day, and adding a Christmas list makes that worse. Besides the safety cautions from above, you need a strategy to minimize holiday hassles for you and your kids.  Most importantly, keep it small.  When it comes to decorations and shopping, small and tasteful beats big and garish.  Make small amounts of special Christmas food and involve the kids when you do, so cooking becomes more of a positive for you both. Second most important: keep the kids’ routine.  Make bedtimes and meal times pretty normal.  If things get chaotic, kids get more stressed.  Again, make sure your kids are mostly eating a regular healhy diet.  And like we say in almost every column in this series, everyone’s should wash hands- that’s the best prevention for illness. Humorist Dave Barry wrote: “No matter how hectic it gets, you need to remember what the holidays are all about…exactly how much can you charge on your credit cards before going to jail?”  Don’t be that Christmas parent; keeping it simpler equals Peace On Earth. Posted in Christmas safety and happiness | Leave a reply You Don’t Want The Flu! Posted on November 18, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chad Mathews, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Flu season is here.  If you’ve never had the flu, you’re fortunate.  Dr. Hamilton tells the story of when he had it.  Besides the cough, headache, and body aches, he was under the covers shivering violently from fever despite having taken both ibuprofen and Tylenol.  He was shaking so badly he swore he had something worse than influenza, though tests showed that’s all it was.  Since then Dr. Hamilton gets the shot every year. The “flu” we’re talking about is the Influenza virus.  It affects all ages, little ones too.  It usually attacks the upper airways, causing cough, runny nose, and sore throat.  It can also affect the GI tract, with vomiting and diarrhea.  What’s universal is a whole week of misery, with headache and fever and hit-by-a-truck fatigue.  It’s particularly rough on babies, and children with asthma, who are at risk for complications like pneumonia and dehydration. While most viruses have no treatment and must run their course, influenza is one of the few with a medicine that can help- Tamiflu.  Tamiflu may shorten the time kids are sick, and make them less contagious.  It should be started within 48 hours of onset of illness or it won’t help at all, and it only shaves a few days off the week of misery. Thus the best treatment will always be prevention.  Influenza is highly contagious, easily passed between kids by coughing and sneezing on each other, and touching each other with infected hands; in other words flu is passed when kids “slime” one another.  Kids should therefore be taught to cough and sneeze into their hands or elbow crook, and wash their hands often. The other extremely effective weapon against influenza is vaccination.  To illustrate the vaccine’s effectiveness, a 2014 study showed 74% decreased pediatric intensive care admissions in vaccinated kids; meaning 74% fewer kids got influenza’s life-threatening complications.  And a flu vaccine not only protects the kid who gets it, but all the other kids around him whom he WON’T infect. I know one old Cajun who just won’t get the influenza vaccine.  He agrees it’s a good idea and used to get the vaccine every year.  However, he got sick every year right after the shot.  In fact, it seemed he was getting the flu itself- long lasting cough, fever, aches, fatigue, upset stomach.  “Ain’t goin’ do it,” he exclaims, “had enough gittin’ sick from dat shot!” Like we mentioned above, influenza virus is highly contagious, and highly miserable.  It comes around in wintertime, makes you and your kids feel rotten for a whole week, and spreads easily.  Besides hand washing and avoidance, vaccination is the best way to prevent getting it. Why do you need a shot every year?  Don’t you stay immune?  Unfortunately, every year the influenza virus changes chemically- it evolves to fool your immune system and sneak by.  So every few years scientists have to make predictions about how the virus might change, and tweak the vaccine’s design. Then you need the new shot to cover the new strain. What about that old Cajun who believes he gets the flu from the shot?  I’ve encountered other families who refused the vaccine because of this concern.  However, it’s impossible to get influenza from the vaccine.  This is because the virus in the vaccine is either “inactivated,” meaning it’s ability to reproduce in your body has been removed, or the vaccine is “recombinant,” meaning that only pieces of the virus are in the vaccine. So saying you can get the flu from the vaccine is like saying you are going to drive your car to the store, even though the engine has been removed (“inactivated”), or the only parts of your car available are the steering wheel and a fender (“recombinant”). Either way, you’re not getting to the store. People who seem to get influenza from the vaccine are actually catching the flu (or other illnesses) around the time they’re getting vaccinated, but before the vaccine can “take.”  If you’re in the office waiting for your shot, and the kid next to you already has it and coughs on you, too late!  You’re going to get sick before your immune system has a chance to build immunity to the virus.  Bad luck! Posted in Influenza | Leave a reply Why Is Your Pediatrician So Grumpy? Posted on November 3, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply I was worried I had a brain tumor.  That afternoon at work, I began having double vision. I could correct it by tilting my head, but as the day went on I was talking with parents with my head cocked over more and more.  My Fourth Cranial Nerve was malfunctioning, a nerve that controls eye movement, and it was weakening by the hour. I needed an MRI and couldn’t get one where I worked at the time. The next morning I called my internist to get seen, but the receptionist said, “Go see an eye doctor.”  ”You don’t understand,” I explained, “It’s a cranial nerve, not my eye, and I need to get seen.” She still stalled me until I pulled the “doctor” card, insisting I speak to my colleague.  She put me on hold, then came back on: “He said ‘go see an eye doctor.’” I hung up, not believing my ears. Coincidentally I had a check-up scheduled that day with Dr. David Fisher, my optometrist. Fortunately, David knew exactly what was wrong. My vision was already recovering, and he explained that that nerve goes funky occasionally, especially in plumbers who bang their heads on the underside of sinks.  No worries about brain tumors, whew!  Then I found a new internist. Why do doctors, supposedly caring professionals, sometimes act insensitive or downright grumpy?  It starts when applying to medical school.  You need good grades in a tough science curriculum to get in, and nerds don’t always learn people skills, being too busy learning study skills.  Then in medical school you are surrounded by other “medical nerds,” and don’t learn how to relate to non-scientists. Then comes residency.  My father was a seminary professor, and once gave a workshop for hospital chaplains.  He told me of a priest who had observed that the hours are so long and punishing, the apprentice doctors in residency get the humanity “ironed out of them.” After graduating, some regain their hearts, some don’t. All doctors get grumpy.  For me one time, it was a mom who kept interrupting. Her child had a headache, and I was explaining that I didn’t think she had a brain tumor, but needed a CT scan to be sure. But every sentence I started, before I could get to the CT part, mom cut me off with “that’s all stupid, I want a CT.” I finally snapped and shouted, “Shut up, quit interrupting, and I’ll tell you what you want to hear!” Everyone, especially doctors, gets grumpy in “people” professions.  While most patients are nice and polite, some aren’t.  And doctors don’t always start life warm and fuzzy. As we discussed above, medical schools select for academic performers rather than kindly grannies with a twinkle in their eyes.  Then comes the rigors of residency, where long hours and crushing responsibilities turn the nicest guys into ogres. After residency, the hours and the responsibilities don’t quit.  Fatigue is an occupational hazard, and one continues to have to make potentially life-and-death decisions all day. Doctors dread the patient coming back to the hospital, maybe dying, after making a judgement call that turned out wrong.  Dr. Richard Selzer explained this internal struggle best: “Yet he may continue to pretend, at least, that there is nothing to fear, that death will not come, so long as people depend on his authority.  Later, after his patients have left, he may closet himself in his darkened office, sweating and afraid.” So doctors sometimes get snappish, and may seem uncaring about your child’s suffering. Yet worry for patients caused the stress in your doctor in the first place.  So if your kid’s doctor seems grumpy, give him or her a break, a second chance to recover. If he continues to seem uncaring, get a new one. Posted in Becoming a doctor , Picking a Doctor | Leave a reply Mammal Bites Posted on October 21, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Marc Fernandez and April Weliever, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. We see it all the time in the Emergency Department: the family cat bit the toddler, “a wild raccoon bit our girl,” “the neighbor’s dog bit our boy,” the neighbor’s boy bit our boy!”  Dog and cat bites are the most common bites, usually from the family or neighbor’s pet. Sometimes kids will chomp other kids hard enough to warrant a visit to the ER. Our country sees between 2 and 5 million ER visits per year for bites, costing the medical system about $1 billion dollars per year.  That’s a lot of meat-eaters!  And those are the ones that come for care- there’s many more that don’t come in, getting taken care of at home.  Most ER visits are for dog bites, followed by cat bites, then bites by rodents and other smaller, wild animals, and least of all, human bites. What bites need the doctor?  The most obvious bites to bring in are those that break the skin-these all need assessment, because they’re at risk for infection.  Some bites that don’t break the skin may also need to be seen: crush injury that might damage bone, nerve, or tendon, or cause significant pain.  When bringing a child for care, there are other considerations: was it a pet or a wild animal?  Is the animal vaccinated?  Is the child vaccinated? Before coming to the ER it’s good to clean the wound. Most bites kids get are on the arms, legs, hands, or face.  Running the wound under tap water is a great way to get some of the infection-causing bacteria out.  Gently scrub a wound that can’t be run under water (like on faces).  At the hospital we can numb wounds that need more extensive cleaning. The next consideration is x-rays.  Most bites and scratches don’t need these.  However, sometimes an animal tooth can break off in a deep wound.  X-rays can find if there’s a bit of tooth that needs to be removed. The most common story involves the neighbor’s dog.  The child goes out to play, walks by the neighbor’s property, and the dog runs out and bites.  These kids usually get it in the back of the leg, while running away from the dog.  The next most common story is the toddler or pre-school kid playing with the family pet.  She puts her face too close to the pet, the pet gets nervous, and snaps at the child. We talked above about which of those bites needs medical attention- broken skin or crush injuries.  Which bites needs stitches?  We usually close open wounds with stitches, but not always with animal bites. Animal bites are at high risk for infection, and the last thing you want is to sew those nasty bugs into your child’s skin.  For this reason we don’t stitch most bites- except face wounds that need them for cosmetic reasons, to minimize disfiguring scars. All animal bites that break the skin get antibiotics.  This is especially true for deep wounds or puncture bites that might drive bacteria in to where they can’t be easily washed out. Also, the places kids get bitten (arms and legs) have poorer blood supplies to clean up infection.  And when kids get bitten on the face, wound infections can increase scarring, so those get antibiotics too. Vaccine considerations are very important.  Animal bites are at risk for two deadly infections: rabies and tetanus.  If your child gets tetanus, he or she will get very sick, and have a high risk of dying.  If your child gets rabies, he or she WILL die.  Thus we always ensure that bitten kids are up-to-date on tetanus vaccination.  We also need to know the biting animal is rabies-free. Animal Control is called to find the offending animal, check its vaccine status, and quarantine it.  If the animal remains rabies-free after 10 days, it goes home.  If the animal can’t be found, the child needs rabies vaccination. By far the best way to treat mammal bites is prevention.  Children should be taught to stay away from wild animals, and give neighbor’s dogs a wide berth.  Toddlers should never play with family pets- neither toddlers nor animals have the skills to avoid confrontation. “Confrontation” meaning: one animal bites the other. Posted in Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply Cozy Does Not Equal Safe Posted on October 7, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply She thought she was doing the right thing.  She was leaving baby for two minutes to get her toddler dressed.  She put the 4 month-old in the middle of the bed and rolled up blankets around the edges in case baby scooted over, so baby wouldn’t fall off. Minutes later she came back, finding baby against one of the blanket rolls face- in, pale and limp.  She screamed for her husband to call 911, snatched up baby, and began rescue breaths.  When the paramedics arrived, the infant was breathing. When they got to me in the Emergency Department, baby was still groggy but awake, and we all heaved a sigh of relief.  And shuttered to think, what if mom had been another few minutes….. October is SIDS Awareness Month.  SIDS is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, sometimes called crib death, wherein babies are put down to sleep and found dead.  In the last 50 years it was surmised that many of these deaths were from smothering, babies often being found face down in thick bedclothes.  Two decades ago the American Academy of Pediatrics began it’s Back-To-Sleep campaign, encouraging parents to put their babies to sleep on their backs.  The SIDS death rate plummeted. Since then we’ve found other factors in crib deaths.  When my kids were infants, my pediatric-nurse wife and I put them to bed on their backs, but on sheepskin, with bumper pads in their cribs.  We also placed stuffed animals with them.  My kids survived, but those things are now on the danger list too. Sheepskins, bumper pads, quilts, plush toys, and pillows are all smothering risks. One risk for SIDS that has been known for centuries is co-sleeping, or sleeping in the same bed or couch with baby.  Even medieval societies recognized this smothering risk. Germany had a law in the year 1291 forbidding women from taking children under 3 years-old into bed.  In 1862, the English Women’s Journal warned, “Nor must we forget a frequent and lamentable cause of death that in which the infant is “overlaid” in its slumbers by a careless, perhaps drunken nurse or mother.” SIDS Awareness Month in October coincides with another fall tradition, Halloween.  In this spirit, doctors at Montreal Children’s Hospital invented a training tool they called the Crib Of Horrors.  They placed a CPR baby mannequin in a crib with numerous safety hazards, and held a contest wherein staff from different units (Emergency Department, ICU, clinics, etc) would name as many violations as they could find.  The winner was the team that found the most hazards. They included several things we discussed above: piles of blankets near baby’s head that he could smother in, loose pajamas that could cover baby’s face, and other articles in the crib that could suffocate.  There were also more hospital-specific violations, like coils of oxygen tubing that could strangle a rolling baby. The Crib Of Horrors illustrates mistakes that parents often make when putting infants to bed.  Though it looks cozy, a crib with heavy blankets or quilts, stuffed animals, pillows, and bumper pads is unsafe.  And like the oxygen tubing, strings that hold pacifiers, or necklaces, are strangling risks. Babies should sleep in on their backs, face-up, in a thin, one-piece sleeper, on a thin mattress with a fitted sheet. Pacifiers have recently been shown to be protective against SIDS, so they’re okay.  But no strings attached. When babies get colds, they become noisy breathers, rattling and snorting at night, occasionally gagging and vomiting mucus.  Parents become worried that baby may choke to death on secretions (which actually is NOT a SIDS risk).  To watch baby more closely, they violate the cardinal rule about not bringing baby into bed with them.  Unfortunately, “watching baby” often becomes “sleeping with baby.” Like we mentioned above, the smothering hazards of “co-sleeping” with infants has been recognized for centuries.  We recommend “co-rooming”, where baby sleeps in a crib next to parent’s bed.  Thus baby is watched without being in the adult’s bed where pillows, blankets, thick mattresses, and the adults themselves become smothering risks. Cozy does not equal safe when it comes to sleeping babies.  Keep infants on their backs, even if they have colds- babies are designed to handle congestion and reflexively keep their airways clear lying face-up.  Be sure your infant’s bed doesn’t become a Crib Of Horrors.

It was mango season on Saba island, Netherlands Antilles.  My wife and I were on the beach eating some, and we decided to give our 8 month-old daughter a taste.  She liked it, but then paradise turned scary- she became lethargic, turned blue around the lips, was twitching, and seemed to stop breathing.  We called 911 and the island police rushed her to the local ER.  By the time we arrived, she was awake, pink, and breathing fine.  And now had a 103 degree fever. This was our first “febrile seizure,” and it had nothing to do with the mango.  Our daughter had an ear infection, which caused the fever, which led to the seizure. What is a febrile seizure?  Simply, it’s when a child has a seizure with a fever. The child suddenly goes unconscious, has rhythmic twitching of the face, arms or legs, and is unarousable.  The child’s breaths are so shallow that it’s hard to tell if they are breathing.  After a few minutes of seizing, the child relaxes and breathes normally, and though sleepy and confused-acting, can be aroused.  After 10 to 20 more minutes he becomes more awake. Febrile seizures only happen to about 4% of kids, but they sure are memorable when they do!  It’s frightening to watch, but doesn’t cause lasting harm.  Intelligence and other aspects of brain development aren’t affected- these kids grow up fine.  And kids do breathe adequately during seizures, although it’s tough to tell. More good news: most kids who have febrile seizures never have another.  About one third of these kids have more than one, but they all outgrow them by 6 years of age. Febrile seizures happen between ages 6 months to 5 years.  How high the fever goes, or how fast it goes up, has nothing to do with having a seizure.  Thus if your child has a fever of 104, that does not mean they’re going to seize.  Some kids seem to get them, most don’t.  In fact, seizures usually happen before the onset of fever, so if your child is already hot, it’s less likely that they’ll have one. During my second year of medical school, it happened again.  My daughter was 16 months at the time.  She was playing with the neighbor’s kids when she suddenly stopped, fell straight back on the floor, and began shaking.  The other mothers freaked out, but my wife assured them that it was “only a seizure.”  She sure got some strange looks!  Then the fever started, and it turned out to be another ear infection. As we discussed above, febrile seizures are scary to watch, but are actually no reason to panic.  They don’t hurt child’s brain, kids breathe adequately during the seizure, and go on to grow up fine.  Easy to say, but what do I do if my child has one? First, stay calm.  Roll the child onto his side, so if he won’t choke if vomiting. Don’t put things in the mouth.  Some people worry kids will “swallow their tongue” or bite their tongue, and think sticking something in will help- wrong!  Kids don’t choke during seizures, and shoving things in can hurt their teeth and mouth. Don’t try to stop the jerking either- you can’t, and again may hurt the child by trying. Watch the time.  Seizures lasting past 5 minutes may require treatment. If the seizure is going that long, call 911.  Paramedics carry medication that can stop seizures. Once the seizure is over, the child should see a doctor, to determine the source of the fever. Fevers are usually caused by viruses that go away by themselves, but sometimes kids have bacterial causes like ear infections, and need antibiotics.  Blood tests are mostly unnecessary after febrile seizures. Can you prevent febrile seizures?  Regular dosing with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen don’t prevent them. Giving anti-seizure medication, like for kids with epilepsy, may help.  However, in most cases this is not recommended. Potential side effects of daily anti-seizure medications usually outweigh the benefits. Remember- febrile seizures are not harmful. The only danger is leaving kids in the bathtub unattended and they seize and drown.  But you shouldn’t leave kids alone in the tub anyway, seizures or not. Febrile seizures are scary for parents.  Follow the plan above, recognize the signs and symptoms, and stay calm!

Sigh.  If only more teenagers would know this before they got pregnant.  Most teenagers are told at least once about the chores of pregnancy- pain, nausea, weight gain, fatigue. And about that screaming, pooping baby after.  But alas, teenagers aren’t good listeners.  Like toddlers, they are better explorers, and have to try things out for themselves.  But unlike toddlers, they get to try driving fast, drinking alcohol, staying out late, and sex. Some parents abet their teenagers’ exploration.  These parents explain this way- better that my kid tries these things at home where I can monitor their safety.  They let their teen and friends drink at home, stay up, and even have a live-in boyfriend or girlfriend.  They believe this makes a friendly relationship with their teen, and they can be there when the teenager fails. Unfortunately, with sex, the failing is pretty hard.  When a teen drinks too much, they usually can sleep it off and weather the hang-over.  When my daughter missed a turn and skidded off the road into a ditch, she was unhurt and it was only a bumper repair.  But when a teenager gets pregnant, the aftermath isn’t so easy.  Pregnancy is a life-changing event that can’t be shaken off like a hang-over.  What about the birth control I got my daughter, or the condoms I bought my son?  Well, just like driving a car safely takes experience, taking birth control pills daily or using barrier methods properly in the heat of the moment requires care to get right.  And if they don’t get it right… So you ask, what can we do?  Teenagers want to try stuff- driving fast, drinking, sex.  You tell us that teens are going to try these no matter what we say- they are better explorers than listeners, right?  And like our permissive parents above, letting the teen do these things at home where we can watch is a bad idea, because we still won’t be there at the crucial moment to prevent pregnancy.  So again, what to do? The first thing is to explain the facts of life before your kids are teens, when they are still good listeners, before they become eye-rollers.  Elementary school age is best to discuss safe driving, drinking, and sex.  This is when you teach about the miseries of pregnancy, and how the fun-loving teen years are over when baby comes.  How tiring it is to feed baby and listen to all that crying .  Dirty, stinky diapers.  Spitting up.  And how if you have a baby with someone, that binds you as parents for the rest of your lives.  That guy may be cute now, but do you want to be raising a child with him, stuck together forever in a loveless pseudo-marriage of co-parenting? Second, for those parents who are permissive so they can monitor their teens drinking and partying, stop!  Teens don’t need their parents to be friends; they have friends.  Teens actually want a parent who is an authority figure.  Teens know they may act out-of-control, and a parent who sets guidelines is a comfort.  My wife and I are pretty careful about where we let our youngest daughter go, and once when we okayed her to go to a party, she did a double-take: “Wait, you’re actually letting me go?  What if there’s drinking?”  She seemed a little disappointed that we didn’t say no. Teen pregnancy and parenting is a chore, thousands of times worse than having to do the dishes or make the bed.  Warn your kids when they are young and instill those guidelines, so that they are well aware of the Big Accident waiting to happen, before it does. Posted in Teen Pregnancy- How it is bad | Leave a reply No, Drinking Mt. Dew Will NOT Prevent Pregnancy! Posted on November 28, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 This happens at least once per month, the last time just three weeks ago.  A teenager comes into the Emergency Department complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting in the morning for a week or two; and by the way, has not had a period for three months.  When her pregnancy test comes back positive, her denial is profound.  “No way, its impossible that I’m pregnant!” she cries.  In fact, sometimes the teenager seems so convinced that she can’t be pregnant that I begin to wonder if the test was wrong. Then after further questioning, her denial begins to fall apart.  “I didn’t have sex” becomes “I didn’t have sex in the past four months.”  That is followed by “I didn’t have sex in the bad part of my cycle.”  Did you use birth control?  “Yes!”  How many times?  “Once.”  Aha. Teenagers who get pregnant sometimes mean to get pregnant.  Many times though, they get pregnant because they had wrong ideas about pregnancy prevention.  Not only do teens have wrong beliefs about how pregnancy happens, they often have almost magical thinking about how they cannot get pregnant. Here are some of the wrong beliefs teens have about getting pregnant (remember, the following are ALL WRONG!): You can only get pregnant at certain times of the month.  You can’t get pregnant the first time you have sex.  Drinking Mt Dew, sipping a little clorox, or doing jumping jacks after sex can prevent pregnancy. Furthermore, some teens get even more odd, almost magical, beliefs about their invulnerability to pregnancy.  For example, they come to believe that they or their partner are sterile.  How they get to this idea is strange, since sterility is a diagnosis that is pretty much made after seeing a fertility specialist and a battery of tests.  What teenage male of female has undergone that?  Or sometimes, a teenager just plain denies that she can get pregnant.  Oh no, not me. However, the truth is this: if you have sex once, at any time, you can get pregnant.  Period.  End of Sentence.  No Buts.  Birth control or not. If you don’t want your teen to get pregnant, and you want to get around the odd beliefs, start talking to her (and him!) before they are teens and are prone to magical thinking.  Talk to them when they are in elementary school and junior high.  Make sure they know that sex = risk of pregnancy, and only abstinence or birth control can prevent it.  And birth control is not perfect.  After all, birth control requires forethought and can be a little tricky to get right, like driving a car.  How good is your teen at driving a car? Finally, I have one more thing to say.  Any time you have sex, you can get pregnant.  Got it? Posted in Teen Pregnancy- How it is bad | 1 Reply Babies Having Babies Posted on November 14, 2011 by klfydoctor 2 Take it from me, the father of three teenagers: teenagers are trouble.  They whine and grump when asked to do the dishes, fold clothes, or clean up.  They beg for fast food day and night.  The good manners they practiced just a few years ago are forgotten.  Now, I say all this in fun, because my teens are essentially good kids, as are most teens.  But if you want a truly difficult and unhappy teen, with a truly miserable life, have a pregnant one. First, there are the usual problems with pregnancy.  There is often pain, as baby grows inside, and the pain of delivery.  There is morning sickness and abnormal bleeding.  There are worries about infections and miscarriages.  Now, give all these problems to a teenager- guess how well they will handle them?  Added to that, teen pregnancies tend to be more complicated, with things like  high blood pressure and premature birth. Secondly, there are the emotional problems of teen pregnancy.  How will I raise baby- change diapers, feed baby, get baby to sleep (you think chores are hard now!)?  Will the father be involved?  If so, can I stand to be associated with him for the rest of my child’s life?  What will my parents think, and do?  Teens, not surprisingly, have much worse problems with depression after delivery than adult moms. Finally, after baby is born, the life of a teen mother with baby is very hard.  Being a teen mom is a sure way to poverty- raising babies is hard enough without having to finish school or hold down a job, and babies are very expensive to clothe, feed, and entertain.   Babies of teens are more often premature, and thus sicker, and need to be brought to the doctor or the Emergency Department much more.  A depressed teen mom makes for a depressed and fussy baby.  Many teens have babies so that they will have a baby to love them, and are often disappointed that babies at first give so little love for all the hardship. So what is the best way to avoid the living hell of teen pregnancy?  For parents, showing your teen this blog will probably not work.  Scare tactics seldom have an effect on teens.  They are not rational decision makers, much like toddlers.  You need to talk to your child before they are in high school, or even junior high.  The age you can teach your kid about not getting pregnant is when they are in grade school. Parents, get to work!  Have that uncomfortable conversation (it actually is pretty easy with grade-schoolers) now, so your babies don’t have babies before their time is right.

This is a procedure where a needle is put into the back to obtain fluid from the spinal cord.  This fluid comes from the brain and is used to diagnose meningitis.  Instead of a trickle of clear fluid we see in well kids, yellow pus-laden spinal fluid shot out of the needle onto my gowned chest. This definitely was meningitis. The last procedure I did was to sedate him and put him on life-support, and then I did my best to comfort his parents as he went to the ICU. The year was 1995.  The episode above happens less often now, thanks to the meningococcus vaccine introduced in 2005.  This is one of the vaccines kids get at age 11-12.  Yet a large amount of teens aren’t getting this and some other life-saving vaccines.  One-in-ten adolescents don’t get a tetanus booster, almost 1 in 4 don’t get the meningococcus vaccine, and less than half of teens get the cancer-preventing HPV vaccine! Why are so many teens not getting these crucial shots?  The main reason is many no longer go to their regular doctor- parents fall out of the habit of taking them there. This because older kids don’t get the flurry of vaccines that the younger ones need, and don’t get sick as often.  On the occasion that an older child does get sick, walk-in clinics are more convenient- no waiting for an appointment!  With no regular doctor visits, there is no one to remind the parents that their kid needs this one more vital set of shots. Most “quick-care” does not care about illness prevention, scoliosis, acne, and keeping up vaccines. What are teen vaccines, and why are they so important?  The most dramatic infection they prevent is the meningococcus/meningitis bacteria that our teen above had (cliff-hanger resolution: he survived and walked out of the hospital six days later). Meningoccus is highly contagious, particularly in crowded living conditions that teens often go live in: college dorms and military barracks.  Remember the UL-Lafayette meningitis scare from a few years back?  And once a teen gets meningococcus, he or she can get deathly ill very quickly.  Fortunately this is becoming less common as successive years of kids get vaccinated. The least given vaccine for teens is the cancer-preventing HPV vaccine.  This is partly because HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) causes a less dramatic infection than meningococcus- teens get some warts in sensitive spots.  Also HPV is a three-vaccine series rather than just one shot for meningococcus- you’ve got to go back two more times to complete the series. However, HPV causes deadly cervical cancer and anal cancer (actress Farrah Fawcett died from anal cancer).  The vaccine prevents this.  But cancer is also less dramatic than meningoccus in this way: what teen and parent are looking ahead to the “later in life” of cancer?  Worrying about cancer down the road is just not on many teens’ and parents’ radar.  Surviving Driver’s Ed and teen parties are drama enough. Finally, teens need to get two other vaccines: influenza vaccine and the good ol’ tetanus booster “Tdap.”  Influenza season approaches, and influenza is a nasty virus causing a whole week of cough, fever, body aches, headaches, nausea, and sometimes worse. Get the “flu” shot every year to avoid this highly contagious misery. And tetanus is a deadly illness that can infect any dirty wound- not just rusty nail pokes. What kid doesn’t get dirty wounds? So don’t lose touch with your child’s “regular” doctor as your kid becomes a teen.  Your regular doctor knows your child best and treats the whole kid, unlike a “quick-care” clinic that only cares about your child’s latest illness.  Your kid’s doctor knows what your child truly needs for things like scoliosis, sports and school physicals, and acne.  And when to get the Teen Vaccines.

Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. This entry was posted in Play time , Teen Health Care by klfydoctor .

Telemedicine serves high-population business, government and education centers by providing interactive physician access through the digital realm. High-definition TV screens, two-way audio and high-speed Internet access links a physician from their office to these 21st Century clinics in real time. LGH opened the area’s first telemedicine clinic in 2012 at Stuller, Inc.'s global headquarters, providing its 1,200 associates daily access to primary care physicians and other medical resources. Tools, such as digital stethoscope or otoscope, transmit accurate and real-time readings to the physician’s office. A nurse at the clinic aids the patient and serves as a communication liaison for the physician. A telemedicine clinic has also been established at Ossun Elementary School, linking it to the full clinic at Carencro Middle School, serving over 600 students there. This eases transportation burdens on the school and on parents. It also minimizes missed classroom time for students who otherwise had to leave the school to be seen. Lafayette Consolidated Government established its first telemedicine clinic at its City Hall headquarters on University Avenue in March, 2015.  That clinic provides physician access for more than 2,200 LCG employees. Physicians who provide telemedicine services are located either at LGH’s Urgent Care Centers, or at the private practice of a Family Medicine physician employed by the Lafayette General Medical Doctors physician group. First developed for NASA astronauts, telemedicine can help prevent long-term health problems in communities by making it easier for people to seek professional treatment, rather than letting conditions worsen. Left unchecked, minor conditions may eventually require urgent care or an emergency room visit. Places serviced with telemedicine see a happier, healthier and more productive population.

Posted on August 9, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply In the past weeks the news has reported on stomach virus epidemics in several states.  More than the usual amount of kids and adults have had vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.  Though Louisiana wasn’t listed, we in the pediatrics business in Lafayette have been seeing more of these viruses too. Now with school starting, we will see even more vomiting and diarrhea in kids and their families.  Why is that?  First, stomach viruses are most often caught from other people.  People who already have the virus and are vomiting and having diarrhea, get the virus on their hands and in their saliva.  When they touch others, or others drink after them or kiss them, the virus gets into the next person’s body.  Viruses can be left by the contaminated person on surfaces like door knobs, kitchen counters, and faucet handles.  When someone touches the contaminated surface they pick up the virus.  Then they touch their face or lick a finger, and the virus gets inside and sets up shop. Now you can see why hand washing is so important.  Soap and water are great at washing viruses off your hands to keep you from picking up and ingesting viruses, and to keep you from passing a virus you might have to others.  And touching your face?  It turns out that the average person touches their face about 300 times per day, usually unknowingly.  So keep those hands clean so they don’t bring viruses to your face and your body’s “intake” (mouth and nose). If you want to see a great blockbuster movie about virus spreading, watch Contagion, starring Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet.  It is a thriller about a new influenza virus that spreads around the world causing widespread panic and death.  The possibilities in the movie are all too real.  And throughout the movie I saw many instances where I said to myself, “If only that character had washed her hands.  Then she wouldn’t have died.” But what exactly is a virus?  What are these things that cause so many illnesses like vomiting and diarrhea, or colds, or fevers?  Simply put, a virus is a microscopic particle that acts like a tiny robot.  It is a crystal-shaped chemical machine that injects its own DNA into a person’s own cells.  The viruses’ DNA takes control of a cell and turns the cell into a virus-making factory.  The cell eventually swells with so many viruses inside and then bursts, spewing those cells to swirl around the microscopic environment of your body.  That next generation of viruses takes over more cells. Fortunately, we have an immune system.  Over a matter of days the immune system recognizes the viral invasion and counter-attacks.  It cleans up the virus and the body’s healing ability repairs the damage by replacing the destroyed cells with new ones.  The body also gets rid of viruses by ejecting them from the body- through sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and diarrhea.  This is good for our bodies but bad for those around us.  Others pick up those viruses with their hands and mouths as we talked about above, and get sick too. One of the great inventions of the 1800s was the idea of hand-washing and public health.  Before then, one of every five infants died of an infection before they reached 12 months of age.  Children and adults died much more often of infections too.  Armies, with their troops crammed together in camps, lost many more men from disease than from battles. Then science discovered that “cleanliness is next to godliness.”  Clean hands became popular.  Cities and army camps started providing clean water and sewage management.  Death rates from infection dropped dramatically.  Many more lives have been saved by hand washing and city sewer pipes than by antibiotics or vaccines.  What better disease prevention could there be than moving massive amounts of germs away from where people live, eat, and drink? The lessons are clear- wash your hands!  Teach your kids before school starts to wash theirs.  Wash them after blowing the nose, touching others, using the bathroom, or touching a possibly dirty surface.  Show your kids how to keep safe, from Contagion! Posted in Back To School Health | Leave a reply Back To School, Not The ER Posted on August 12, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply My kids and yours are heading back to school in the next few weeks.  They’re going to get new teachers, new class mates, new books.  They are also going to get some new germs too, if they are not careful. We in the pediatrics game are bracing for the onslaught of sick kids that happens every year after the kids have been in school for a while.  Kids share the latest germs by wiping their noses and then touching their classmates, coughing and sneezing on each other, and little ones sticking their fingers in each others’ mouths.  Older kids share drinks, and of course teenagers kiss (gasp!). How do we protect our kids from the contagious-disease-factory known as school?  First, we need to remind them about good hygiene- hand washing, not sharing drinks, covering mouths when coughing and sneezing.  Second, we need to take them to the doctor if they need vaccines or refills on preventative medicines, such as those for asthma kids.  Third, if there are no sinks handy for handwashing at school, think about equipping your kids with a bottle of hand sanitizer.  DO THESE THINGS NOW!  WRITE YOURSELF A REMINDER NOW! Finally, one of the best preventions for illness is a healthy diet.  Vitamin pills just don’t cut it near as well as good food.  No fast food.  No junk foods or soda in the house.  A fruit with every meal.  High fiber breads and cereals.  Milk or yogurt two to three times daily.  Veggies with lunch and dinner. Please make life easier for me and my overworked colleagues- follow this advice.  And if your child does get sick, be sure to use the emergency departments only for EMERGENCIES.  Long wait times in emergency rooms are caused by too many people clogging the system with minor illnesses like coughs, runny noses, fevers, sore throats, ear aches, and rashes.  So use your family doctor and the ER wisely.  And wash those hands!

It is designed to relieve pain caused by joint degeneration. By targeting only the damaged part of the knee, your surgeon can repair the knee while sparing healthy bone and ligaments surrounding it. In hip replacement cases, the robotic arm helps provide unprecedented surgical accuracy. A hip replacement by the surgeons with the Lafayette General family is second to none. We understand that making sure you know what to expect from your joint replacement experience is important to you. Each patient is unique, and can experience joint pain for different reasons. It’s important to talk to our orthopedic specialists about the reason for your joint pain so you can understand the treatment options available to you. It is common for patients to try medication and other conservative treatments to treat their hip pain or knee pain. If you haven’t experienced adequate joint pain relief with those treatment options, you may be a candidate for Mako total hip replacement surgery, total knee replacement surgery or partial knee replacement surgery, which may provide you with joint pain relief.

Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology provides you with a personalized surgical plan based on your unique anatomy. First, a CT scan of the diseased hip or knee joint is taken. The CT scan is uploaded into the Mako System software, where a 3D model of your hip or knee is created. This 3D model is used to pre-plan and assist your surgeon in performing your hip replacement or knee replacement surgery. In the operating room, your orthopedic surgeon follows your personalized surgical plan while preparing the bone for the implant. The orthopedic surgeon guides the robotic-arm within the pre-defined area and the Mako System helps the surgeon stay within the planned boundaries that were defined when the personalized pre-operative plan was created. In a laboratory study, Mako Total Knee Technology demonstrated accurate placement of implants to a personalized surgical plan. This study also showed Mako total knee replacement demonstrated soft tissue protection to the ligaments around the knee.  In patient and laboratory studies on Mako total hip replacement and partial knee replacement, Mako Technology demonstrated accurate placement of implants to a personalized surgical plan. Partial Knee Replacement vs. Total Knee Replacement Based on the severity of the arthritis in your knee, total or partial knee replacement may be recommended by your surgeon. Both procedures involve the orthopedic surgeon guiding the Mako Robotic-Arm to remove diseased bone and cartilage. Mako robotic-arm assisted partial knee replacement is a treatment option for adults living with early to mid-stage osteoarthritis (OA) that has not yet progressed to all three compartments of the knee. Depending on where the arthritis affects the knee, patients may have an implant inserted in any of the following areas: Partial Knee Replacement Personalized Planning In comparison, Mako robotic-arm assisted total knee replacement is a treatment option for adults living with mid to late-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. With Mako total knee replacement, the entire knee joint is replaced and the orthopedic surgeon inserts a knee implant. Total Knee Replacement Personalized Planning Total Hip Replacement Mako robotic-arm assisted total hip replacement is a surgical procedure intended for patients who suffer from non-inflammatory or inflammatory degenerative joint disease (DJD). Some forms of DJD include osteoarthritis (OA), post-traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), avascular necrosis (AVN) and hip dysplasia. It’s important to understand the MAKO robotic-arm assisted surgery is performed by an orthopedic surgeon, who guides the robotic-arm during the surgery to position the implant in the knee and hip joints. The Mako Robotic-Arm does not perform surgery, make decisions on its own or move without the orthopedic surgeon guiding it. The Mako System also allows your orthopedic surgeon to make adjustments to your plan during surgery as needed.

Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child. Posted in Animal Bites , Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply Mammal Bites Posted on October 21, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Marc Fernandez and April Weliever, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. We see it all the time in the Emergency Department: the family cat bit the toddler, “a wild raccoon bit our girl,” “the neighbor’s dog bit our boy,” the neighbor’s boy bit our boy!”  Dog and cat bites are the most common bites, usually from the family or neighbor’s pet. Sometimes kids will chomp other kids hard enough to warrant a visit to the ER. Our country sees between 2 and 5 million ER visits per year for bites, costing the medical system about $1 billion dollars per year.  That’s a lot of meat-eaters!  And those are the ones that come for care- there’s many more that don’t come in, getting taken care of at home.  Most ER visits are for dog bites, followed by cat bites, then bites by rodents and other smaller, wild animals, and least of all, human bites. What bites need the doctor?  The most obvious bites to bring in are those that break the skin-these all need assessment, because they’re at risk for infection.  Some bites that don’t break the skin may also need to be seen: crush injury that might damage bone, nerve, or tendon, or cause significant pain.  When bringing a child for care, there are other considerations: was it a pet or a wild animal?  Is the animal vaccinated?  Is the child vaccinated? Before coming to the ER it’s good to clean the wound. Most bites kids get are on the arms, legs, hands, or face.  Running the wound under tap water is a great way to get some of the infection-causing bacteria out.  Gently scrub a wound that can’t be run under water (like on faces).  At the hospital we can numb wounds that need more extensive cleaning. The next consideration is x-rays.  Most bites and scratches don’t need these.  However, sometimes an animal tooth can break off in a deep wound.  X-rays can find if there’s a bit of tooth that needs to be removed. The most common story involves the neighbor’s dog.  The child goes out to play, walks by the neighbor’s property, and the dog runs out and bites.  These kids usually get it in the back of the leg, while running away from the dog.  The next most common story is the toddler or pre-school kid playing with the family pet.  She puts her face too close to the pet, the pet gets nervous, and snaps at the child. We talked above about which of those bites needs medical attention- broken skin or crush injuries.  Which bites needs stitches?  We usually close open wounds with stitches, but not always with animal bites. Animal bites are at high risk for infection, and the last thing you want is to sew those nasty bugs into your child’s skin.  For this reason we don’t stitch most bites- except face wounds that need them for cosmetic reasons, to minimize disfiguring scars. All animal bites that break the skin get antibiotics.  This is especially true for deep wounds or puncture bites that might drive bacteria in to where they can’t be easily washed out. Also, the places kids get bitten (arms and legs) have poorer blood supplies to clean up infection.  And when kids get bitten on the face, wound infections can increase scarring, so those get antibiotics too. Vaccine considerations are very important.  Animal bites are at risk for two deadly infections: rabies and tetanus.  If your child gets tetanus, he or she will get very sick, and have a high risk of dying.  If your child gets rabies, he or she WILL die.  Thus we always ensure that bitten kids are up-to-date on tetanus vaccination.  We also need to know the biting animal is rabies-free. Animal Control is called to find the offending animal, check its vaccine status, and quarantine it.  If the animal remains rabies-free after 10 days, it goes home.  If the animal can’t be found, the child needs rabies vaccination. By far the best way to treat mammal bites is prevention.  Children should be taught to stay away from wild animals, and give neighbor’s dogs a wide berth.  Toddlers should never play with family pets- neither toddlers nor animals have the skills to avoid confrontation. “Confrontation” meaning: one animal bites the other. Posted in Dog and Cat bites | Leave a reply The Dark Side of Fluffy and Rover Posted on March 21, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply It really wasn’t the boy’s fault.  He was playing in his yard when a stray dog wandered over. The dog jumped up and bit the boy on the side of his face. The dog fled and Animal Control couldn’t find it.  Rabies is in the area and there was no way to know if the dog was rabid without capturing and quarantining it. So we had to assume the worst, and start the boy on the rabies vaccines.  The vaccines aren’t so bad- no worse than regular vaccines.  But the rabies immunoglobin, a medicine to prevent the rabies virus spread, must be injected right into the wound.  It was not a good night for the boy or me. Dog and cat bites make up plenty of pediatric ED visits.  Usually it’s a neighbor’s animal or the family pet at fault.  Occasionally it is a stray.  When a child gets bitten, there are lots of medical problems to address.  The most obvious worry is the wound itself.  Kids explore with their faces and hands and want to touch and look closely at any animal. If they get too close and the animal feels threatened, it protects itself by lashing out with tooth and claw. The resulting face wounds sometimes leave scars that even plastic surgery can’t hide. Then there is the worry about infection. There are three infections that dogs and cats can transmit.  The biggest worry is rabies. Rabies is a virus that wild animals get by biting each other.  Rabies attacks the brain, makes the animal go mad and bite other animals (and thus pass the virus on), and then the animal dies.  It is very rare for any animal, or human, to survive rabies once the infection takes.  The next concerning infection is Pasteurella, a bacteria for which we give antibiotics.  The only face laceration I remember getting infected was from a dog bite, though the child was on antibiotics.  The third infection is Tetanus.  This is another good reason to be sure your kids are vaccinated because like rabies, tetanus often kills. The newspapers recently ran a story from Oregon about a 22 pound cat named Lux who attacked his family.  The seven month old baby pulled Lux’s tail, so Lux swiped the baby in the forehead with his claw.  Then he got so aggressive that he trapped the parents in a bedroom until police arrived.  Even more concerning, the family is keeping the cat, getting it “therapy.”  Now, cats are carnivores, meat-eaters who are hard-wired to hunt, kill, and eat.  Some are nicer and more family friendly than others, but I doubt that any therapy will help Lux and a baby get along. My point is not to give cats a bad rap as pets, but to illustrate safety issues.  The first thing is to not have a pet with a toddler.  Toddlers are explorers.  When they explore things they touch them, peer at them, and grab and pull on them.  Dogs and cats are often patient with such behavior, but not always. You can’t know when the ancient purpose buried in their DNA (defend, hunt, kill, eat) will come out with such treatment.  Wait until your kids are school age before getting a dog or cat. Another safety concern is fencing for dogs- to keep them in, or out.  Fences keep your dogs and kids in and away from the neighbors. They also keep other neighbor’s dogs or strays out.  Also, pick a dog breed that is less aggressive.  Terriers, pit bulls, chows, and breeds like them are more aggressive and more difficult to train.  Poodles and retrievers tend to be safer with kids.  Veterinarians can help you pick a breed and tell what behavior to look for in an individual dog.  Finally, teach your children how to treat pets and other animals. Pets are not play-things or wrestling partners.  They need to be played with in appropriate ways, and need to be trained to do the same with your kids. Feel free to get a pet: dogs, cats, and humans have been great companions for thousands of years.  However, dogs and cats have been hunters for even longer- treat that knowledge, and them, with respect.

The nurse’s note read “rash.”  When I walked into the exam room, the mother’s eyes were wide with fear.  ”Doc, over the past 2 days he’s been having a reaction to the antibiotic he got earlier this week.  I gave Benadryl this morning and the rash is still there!  Is he going to be okay?”  Meanwhile, the patient, an 8 year-old boy, was lying in bed laughing at cartoons on TV. The rash certainly wasn’t bothering him much, unlike his mother! Rashes can be distressing for parents of infants and children. They can appear out of nowhere, cover a large part of the body, and look awful.  The good news is that most rashes are not life-threatening and don’t need immediate attention. Some are caused by direct irritation of the skin, some indirectly like with allergies, and some by infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungus. In the case of the boy I saw that Saturday night, his rash wasn’t a sign of anything bad, though it certainly looked weird.  It consisted of flat, paisley-shaped red blotches all over his body.  It didn’t hurt, didn’t itch, and he didn’t feel too bad. This rash, called erythema multiforme, turned out to be due not to the antibiotic,but from an infection called mycoplasma, a.k.a. “walking pneumonia.”  We changed his antibiotic to cover that infection, and off he went. Every year there are about 12 million visits for rashes and other skin concerns.  68% of these are with the patient’s own doctor, leaving 32% to walk-in clinics and Emergency Departments.  How do you know if your kid can wait to see their pediatrician, or needs immediate attention? First, don’t panic at the site of a rash, no matter how much of your child it covers.  Rashes are like fevers- the height of the fever and the amount of rash don’t correlate with severity. It’s more about how your child is acting with the rash.  If she’s calm, drinking easily, breathing comfortably, and awake and with it, then it’s not an emergency. Give benadryl for the itch, call your doctor for reassurance, and chill out. This advice about how to respond to your kid’s rash, brings up an experience I had in my last year of medical school.  It wasn’t about a pediatric patient- it was ME!  I woke one morning after an itchy night.  I turned to my wife to ask if she had used a new laundry detergent on our sheets, and was met with a look of shock: “Justin, ARE YOU OK!?!” Besides being a little itchy, I felt fine.  ”Look in the mirror!  I think you need to go to the hospital now!” I was covered with a rash from head to waist, my face beet red.  A little startling to see, but then I remembered my training.  When did it start?  During the night I guess.  Was I breathing okay?  Yes.  Were my throat, tongue, or lips swollen?  No.  Was it getting worse? Didn’t seem so.  Did I feel ill or have fever?  No. There, no emergency honey. Was the rash raised and itchy?  Yes- thus probably allergic.  Was there peeling, crusting, pain, or weeping?  No- therefore probably not an infection.  Were there tiny red freckles that didn’t blanch when pressed on?  No- again not a serious infection.  What was different in the past few days?  Soaps, detergents, food?  Wait, I’d been stung by a hornet yesterday! The rash I had was urticaria, commonly called hives, a delayed reaction to the sting. When I saw my allergist later that day, she prescribed steroids, an antihistamine, and in two days I was better. When deciding whether your child’s rash can wait for the pediatrician, or needs to be seen immediately, remember the important questions:  Does he appear ill (looking past that awful rash!).  Is there lip, tongue, or throat swelling?  Is she not breathing comfortably? Are there tiny red freckles that don’t blanch when pressed?  If yes, proceed to the nearest Emergency Department. If no to these questions, relax!  Give benadryl, tylenol, or ibuprofen for itching, fever, or other discomfort.  Call your pediatrician if you need further guidance.  Like fevers, rashes are generally not emergencies.  Take a deep breath, take two benadryl, and call me in the morning. Posted in Allergies , Rashes | Leave a reply Was Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer Allergic? Posted on March 22, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply When my son got his first ear infection at 8 weeks old, I might have known.  Soon after he began having continual congestion.  He spent much of his childhood with itchy eyes and nose.  Many pictures from that time show him smiling away with a red nose like Rudolph.  He lived on Zyrtec and Flovent in the winter months in order to keep the itching and coughing down and to help him sleep and not be miserable during the day.  Teenage years came and thank god he outgrew that stuff.  Now his biggest medical complaint is a sore pitching arm. Head allergies are common in kids, though they are sometimes hard to diagnose.  Cold viruses and sinus infections give kids a lot of the same symptoms- runny nose, cough, itching eyes and noses.  Allergies tend to give kids symptoms a lot longer, but young ones in daycares or schools can have long lasting symptoms too because they catch cold virus after cold virus, one right after the other, so it looks like one continous illness.  Chronic asthma can sometimes act like allergies, with continous coughing and chest congestion that doesn’t always wheeze. So how do you tell the difference between continuous colds, allergies, or mild chronic asthma?  Besides the itchy head, does your child get his symptoms with change in seasons?  Is there a history of allergies in mom or dad or other relatives?  Do obvious allergic triggers like animals or dust seem to make the child sneeze and itch?  If it seems like the kid has allergies, one way to make the diagnosis is to try an anti-allergy medicine.  Drugs like Claritin (Loratidine) or Zyrtec (Cetirizine) are pretty effective and very safe, so safe that they can be bought over-the-counter.  If the child gets better in a day or two and stays better on the drug, allergies may be the cause.  Some allergies are hard to diagnose, or hard to treat effectively, in which case the child might need to see the allergist. Your pediatrician or family practitioner can usually diagnose allergies without an allergist’s help.  If the child has lots of eye and nose itching and is always congested, if there is a family history of allergy, that may be enough.  The doctor will often ask for the parent’s help with figuring out what is causing the allergic reaction- dust, dogs, seasonal pollens in the air, mold?  What seems to make their child sneeze and twitch?  Sometimes parents are asked to keep a journal of when their child has symptoms and where they are at the time.  Your doctor can also order blood tests which can give clues to allergy being the problem and what is causing the allergy. If your doctor has trouble figuring out if allergies are truly the cause of the child’s misery, or if standard treatments aren’t working, that is when the child is referred to an allergist.  The allergist can perform more accurate tests to see if the child is allergic, and to what.  Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the allergist then often goes back to the basics for treatment- avoiding the thing the kid is allergic to. Avoidance is the mainstay of allergy treatment.  If dust is the cause, and it often is, then the allergist can talk to the family about dust control in the bedroom and the rest of the house.  If it is cockroaches, another common allergy trigger, they can address that.  If medicines are needed, the allergist can help the family figure out what medicine or combination of medicines would be best.  Finally, if a child has an allergy that is really hard to avoid and treat, the allergist can design a “immunotherapy” program to help the child’s body be less sensitive to the allergen.  These are the”allergy shots.”  Immunotherapy is safe and effective for the right patient, and can make a big difference in the quality of the kid’s life. So if you think your child has allergies, talk to your doctor.  Pay attention to what seems to make your child cough and sneeze and rub his nose and eyes.  Itchy faces can be miserable, take it from my son.

Ear, Nose and Throat (otolaryngology) is the branch of medicine and surgery that focuses on ailments and disorders in the head and neck. Lafayette General Health offers comprehensive care and treatment options for patients of any age at various locations within the system. Our physicians and staff are prepared to handle a multitude of conditions commonly associated with the ear, nose, throat, respiratory tract and other related parts and structures of the upper extremities of the body. For Added Convenience, We Offer: Onsite computed tomography (CT) scans of the sinuses and ear for quick turnaround of results An onsite laboratory for in-office allergy and skin testing Advancements: Balloon Sinuplasty is a noninvasive procedure that uses a tiny balloon catheter to open blocked sinus passages and help drain mucus buildup. Sublingual Allergy Drops replace allergy shots and are equally as effective. When surgery is necessary, most procedures take place at either Lafayette General Surgical Hospital or Oil Center Surgical Plaza located in the Medical Office Building at 1000 W. Pinhook Road. Should an overnight stay be required, our patient suites are private and equipped with sofa beds for loved ones.

Posted on January 9, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Frank Betanski, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. If you have kids, especially a son, you may know the feeling: waking your child in the morning, pulling back the sheets, and getting the pungent smell I call the “Ammonia Sunrise.”  Nocturnal Enuresis (fancy words for bedwetting) is a common problem. Parents of kids who wet the bed come in feeling frustrated and helpless.  The kid has been potty trained for years- except at night!  Bedwetting takes a toll on the patients too. Embarrassed to go on sleepovers, they feel left out. Summer camp or overnight visits to relatives can also be sources of stress rather than anticipation.  I have even heard parents broadcasting their daughter’s daily accident tally at preschool pick-up!  That’s not helping the embarrassment, mom and dad! Let’s start with facts: 1) Bedwetting is defined as urination that happens at an inappropriate time and place.  2)The diagnosis of Nocturnal Enuresis is not made until 5 years old; nighttime dryness is actually the final stage of potty training.  3) At 5 years old, one in five children still wet the bed.  4)  Its genetic, not psychological.  If mom or dad wet the bed, there’s a good chance the child will too. Bedwetting was once thought to be a psychological condition.  We now know that children who wet the bed do not have emotional problems.  Bedwetting is not an act of rebellion or laziness.  It is so common that it can hardly be called “abnormal.” Bedwetting is also not a result of harder-sleeping children.  Sleep studies have shown that children who wet the bed sleep no deeper than other kids.  Surveys of parents, however, show that they still think their kids who wet the bed are “deep sleepers!” How can you treat bedwetting?  The best treatment is the bedwetting alarm.  Originally developed in 1938, it is now found at most shopping centers.  The alarm has been shown to be 75% effective.  The alarm has sensors in the child’s pajama bottoms that detect wetness.  When the child begins to urinate, the alarm wakes the child up.  He then gets out of bed and finishes peeing in the toilet. The idea is that the child learns to wake up when he feels a full bladder and goes pee in the bathroom before going in the bed. The bedwetting alarm also has a high “found in the trash” rate- 20% of parents get frustrated when the device does not train the child right away, and toss it.  This is because the bedwetting alarm is a training tool, not the training!  Parents have some work to do to make it effective. First, parents shouldn’t fuss at their children when they wet the bed.  Its not their fault! Reassure that they are not misbehaving.  Praise them when they help clean up and change the sheets: it’s an opportunity to teach responsibility.  When the child is awakened by the alarm and has some urine left over to pee into the toilet, it’s high-five time!  They may not be dry-all-night yet, but they are on their way.  Be patient- it takes many nights for the alarm to help. Limit fluids, especially caffeinated drinks, before bedtime.  Certainly no sodas or sugary juices at dinner or after.  These drinks are so tasty that children will drink and drink and take in more fluids than they need.  You don’t want a bursting bladder after bedtime. Some parents wake their kids up to use the bathroom one or two hours after they fall asleep.  For sleepovers have your child wear a pull-up.  This sounds odd but can make a big difference.  If they are embarrassed about the pull-up, send them in loose-fitting PJs- no one needs to know. Sometimes kids are prescribed medicines to stop bedwetting, but the American Academy of Pediatrics cautions that these drugs are a last resort and not recommended for children under 5 years old.  These medicines may help in the short term, but do not solve the problem in the long run. When to see your doctor?  When the child has had nighttime dryness, and then begins to wet the bed again.  This can be a sign of a new medical problem such as urine infection, diabetes, constipation, or stress. But if your child has wet the bed since successful daytime potty training, don’t stress. Teach them to help clean up, and that it’s okay.

Posted on October 9, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply It was a mystery to mom: her 10 year-old, autistic boy suddenly was rubbing his eyes and crying.  When she pried his hands away, she saw that his eyes were red with swollen lids, and he obviously hurt.  Was it allergies?  Did pink eye come on this fast? She checked him over to see if he had gotten into anything, felt a lump in his pocket, and pulled out the pepper spray canister that she kept in her purse!  Mystery solved.  She ran his eyes and face under cold water and brought him in. Eye illnesses and injuries often freak people out.  Sight is important, and many fear losing it.  Eyeballs themselves are kinda freaky.  No haunted house is without missing eyeballs, misshapen eyeballs, or eyeballs in a bowl.  Eyes can be mysterious- movies and TV enhance drama by highlighting or shading an actor’s eyes. Emotional response to eye problems makes for a lot of Emergency Department visits. The most common eye problem in the ED isn’t an emergency: conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis is what many call “pink eye,” where the eye is red, watery, and itchy. Sometimes the eyes water clear, sometimes the discharge is green and gooey. Most conjunctivitis is from infection, usually viral.  Like most viruses, pink eye lasts only a few days and goes away on it’s own without antibiotics.  Contrary to popular belief, pink eye is not terribly contagious, and the American Academy of Pediatrics doesn’t consider it a reason to skip school or daycare. Pink eye can also be from allergies to pollen or pet hair exposure.  This “allergic conjunctivitis” lasts as long as the child is exposed, and tends to stay watery and not get gooey and discolored. Swelling around the eye also worries parents.  Usually baby wakes up with one eyelid dramatically swollen, and is rushed to the ER.  Baby seems fine, cooing away and not sick, but it LOOKS bad!  These are usually due to insect bites, and swelling around the eye is more dramatic than bites to other areas because of loose skin and abundant blood supply there. In the iconic movie “A Christmas Story,” 9 year-old Ralphie Parker yearns for a Red Ryder BB gun.  A running gag is Ralphie’s subtle and not-so-subtle begging to his parents and Santa for the gun.  He is invariably turned down with the line, “You’ll put your eye out!” At the end (spoiler alert!), Ralphie gets his BB gun and promptly shoots himself in the eye, or actually, shoots his glasses off.  Fortunately for Ralphie, his glasses saved his eye.  Unfortunately, in real life BB guns can “put your eye out.”  I’ve seen too many BB injuries to eyes and faces of kids, and too many real gunshot wounds there too.  Despite advances in eye surgery, eyesight and/or the eye itself are often lost. Therefore, preventing eye injuries is the best way to preserve vision.  If your child is doing something with potential injury, have them wear safety glasses.  Basketball great Kareem Abdul Jabbar turned geeky protective glasses into cool.  During a college game he got his cornea (the clear dome in front of your iris and pupil) scratched.  Corneal abrasions are intensely painful, and after that he wore glasses.  Corneal abrasions can come from flying particles while woodworking, weed-eating, shooting, and from many sports. Eye strain is another form of eye injury.  In my childhood, parents warned that watching too much TV would “strain” our eyes.  Not knowing what that meant, we ignored them.  It turns out eyestrain is real and much more prevalent today, with smaller screens that have more detail than old TVs, and kids spending way more time looking at them.  Growing up we had one TV at home, and you could tell who the rich kids were because they had two!  Now most kids have a screen in their pocket, or more likely in their faces. Symptoms of eyestrain are watery and itchy eyes, blurry vision, headaches, and light sensitivity.  Eyestrain can be reduced by keeping screens clean, enlarging text, and rest from screen time.  Put off getting your child a phone.  Get their phone when they NEED it, not because they want it for entertainment. Like with the Red Ryder BB gun, you don’t want them to put their eyes out!

In the Sportsman’s Paradise, enjoying the great outdoors means most of us have encountered a snake.  I remember when my father and I were squirrel hunting one evening on a creek bank.  I was following, literally in his footsteps, when he suddenly stopped.  He turned to me and said firmly, “Son, back up now.”  I looked down and saw he was standing on a snake he had accidentally walked on, and he wouldn’t move until I was safely away.  He then pinned the snake behind the neck with a stick, stepped off, and let it slither away.  This was the start of my lifelong hatred of snakes. Between snakes and mosquitoes, it’s sometimes hard to enjoy Louisiana outdoors. Every year about 8,000 people are bitten by poisonous snakes in the United States, with 10-12 deaths.  Louisiana is home to four species of poisonous snakes: the rattlesnake, water moccasin (a.k.a cottonmouth), copperhead, and coral snake.  Most bites happen during summer and fall.  How can we keep children safe during this time of year without confining them to the prison of “inside the house?” Parents can start by keeping kids from playing in tall grass or around large rocks.  These are the preferred environment for snakes.  It’s another incentive to mow the lawn, besides keeping up with the Jones’s.  Children shouldn’t play in vacant lots.  Use extreme caution when moving firewood or stacked lumber.  When outdoors, examine and then designate safe areas before fishing in ponds or swimming in lakes or creeks. Never teach your kids that it’s alright to handle snakes.  This includes not letting them see their crazy uncle (we all have one) catch a snake to remove it, or worse, play with it. Dr. Hamilton had one partner, a life-long swamp rat, who did just that after his son found a snake in the yard.  Instead of staying away, he decided to show his son how to “walk” a snake with a forked stick.  He led the snake just far enough to get himself bitten. What if you or your child fall prey to a poisonous snake’s fangs? We’ve been educated by John Wayne, the Duke himself, on wrapping a belt around your arm, cutting the bite with your bowie knife, and sucking out the venom.  In the movies this always saved his life, yet it’s another case where Hollywood shows us exactly what NOT to do.  Here’s what we SHOULD do. After being bitten, first remove the victim from the snake’s territory. Snakes don’t always bite and slither away; sometimes they stick around and bite again.  Next, don’t panic.  Up to 25% of poisonous snake bites are “dry” bites, where the snake bites but doesn’t inject venom.  If you do get injected, it’s still okay.  The chance of dying from a snakebite is nearly zero in the United States because of high-quality medical care. After calming the victim (and yourself), keep him or her warm and quiet.  Immobilize the injured part with a splint and remove watches, rings, or tight clothing from the affected extremity.  Swelling around these might cut off circulation.  Do NOT apply tourniquets or tigtht dressings.  Loss of blood to the bitten part causes more damage than good. Clean the wound with water. Attempt to identify the snake, as long as that doesn’t endanger anyone. Take a picture from a safe distance.  Don’t handle the snake even if it’s dead, since dead snakes can still bite reflexively.  Don’t try to kill the snake. Many snake bites are from non-poisonous snakes, and killing them gives the rats one less predator to worry about.  And if you try to kill it and get bitten yourself, that’s one more victim to worry about.  Most of all, don’t delay transport just to identify the snake.  Lay the patient down and get going! How does this add up to a $100,000 medical bill?  If anti-venom is needed, treatment takes 6-10 vials, each vial costing about $7500.  Add that to the cost of a hospital stay. I’d rather spend that hundred grand on a yacht or a round-the-world trip.  So don’t be that person who plays with snakes; be the safer, more educated person with a yacht.

Posted on April 21, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply We read about these things in our books, but when they happen for the first time it’s a surprise.  The parents rushed their 8 year-old girl into the Emergency Department.  She had been riding her bike, turned the handlebars too sharply, and tumbled off.  When she fell down the end of the handlebars speared her in the belly.  Soon she was pale and weak. Examining her, the only mark was a quarter-sized bruise just above her belly button.  But she certainly was pale, and when I sat her up, she said “I can’t see,” like she was passing out.  Laying her flat, she suddenly could see again. She clearly was fainting from blood loss, and I had read about the “handlebar-spear” as a risk for internal injury.  While my nurse started the IV and slapped on the monitor leads, I ran and grabbed a second nurse, “I need blood and I need you to hang it!”  Next I called a surgeon, and my girl was off to the OR. Lots of kids need blood.  Some are injured, like our girl above.  But also kids with cancer need blood products too.  The most common childhood cancer is leukemia, which affects bone marrow.  Bone marrow manufactures blood, and leukemia crowds out the good, blood-making cells with cancer cells, and those kids thus need transfusions.  Some chemotherapy drugs also impair marrow function.  Children (and adults) who have heart surgery also need lots of blood, to keep up with surgical losses and to feed the heart-lung bypass machine.  Occasionally premature babies need blood transfusions too. Where does all that blood come from?  You!  Blood doesn’t come from a pharmaceutical factory, but from donors, in our area and across the nation.  Our local blood bank, United Blood Services keeps that vital stuff coming. UBS is a non-profit, charitable organization that provides this crucial resource.  There are UBS centers across the country, and one on Bertrand Drive here in Lafayette.  Their blood-mobiles fan out across Acadiana, going to charity events and churches, schools and universities, stores and work places, to collect blood from volunteers. Giving blood is easy, except this one time for me: I was in medical school, and there was a blood drive in the cafeteria.  The night before, I had been on call in the hospital, too busy to eat or sleep.  I came to the drive pale, hungry, and exhausted, but ready to do my part.  Giving the blood wasn’t bad, but after they put the bandaid on, I saw that they had free cookies and juice.  I leaped out of my chair, bellied up to the table of goodies, and started chowing down. Suddenly, I couldn’t see.  “Gee, that’s weird,” I thought.  Several blood drive staff noticed that I was more pale, had stopped chewing, and was staring off and starting to sway.  While I was still puzzling over my vision black-out, they helped me back into my chair before I fainted completely. Soon my body began to send more blood to my brain and my vision returned.  I learned an important lesson on donating blood- get up slowly after.  Your body needs to adjust to losing a pint.  Also, start eating slowly, sitting down.  When you’re eating, your body shunts blood to your digestive system to absorb all those nutrients.  If the dipstick is low, there may not be enough blood to go around, and it’s harder to pump it up into your head when you’re standing. Giving blood is easy (for well-rested non-medical students), and it’s important!  Like we discussed above, lots of kids in Acadiana need blood to save their lives: accident victims, kids with cancer, children who need heart surgery, and the occasional premature baby.  Donations are down in Acadiana, with the oil down-turn.  Fewer people have an hour to spare to donate.  Companies that once sponsored blood drives have laid off employees that used to be donors.  The employees that are left have to work harder and fear taking company time to donate, not wanting to be labeled a slacker and lose their jobs too. Donations are down, but need isn’t.   Donating is voluntary, and a really good deed.  You might even get a t-shirt or a chance to win a prize.  And I still like free cookies and juice too.

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Post navigation ← Previous Next → Training Dogs and Toddlers Posted on February 23, 2017 by klfydoctor My feisty little poodle, Milou, is all dog.  He’ll fetch endlessly, race around the yard chasing squirrels, and occasionally catch one in a lightning-fast wrestling match. Unfortunately he has a shrill bark that annoys everyone, especially my back-fence neighbor.  When he’s yelling at squirrels there’s no shutting him up. One morning I was shouting “Come!” to get Milou inside.  Ignoring me, he continued yapping at squirrels through the fence, no matter how angry I got.  Why wasn’t he answering the command we had drilled and drilled?  Then I realized, I wasn’t using the same voice I did in practice!  Instead of a harsh, loud “Come!”, I usually used an upbeat happy voice; and practiced “sit” and “stay,” before walking away a few feet, and then “come.” So I called out, “Sit!”  His head came around, yapping cut off.  ”Stay?”  His front paws came around.  ”Come?”  He tore back up the lawn and into the house, squirrels forgotten. I had re-learned the old training rule- dogs listen to voice tone more than actual words. I remembered this some nights later at work, as I heard a mom shout at her 18 month-old daughter, “Sit down!  Shut up!”  I couldn’t see what was going on behind the exam-room curtain, but apparently the toddler wasn’t listening, as mom continued her tirade. The problem with dogs and toddlers, I thought, is that they don’t really speak English. Silly as it sounds, training dogs and toddlers is similar.  Neither understands the meaning of words- meanings must be demonstrated by action.  Both want to please their parents, they just don’t know how, and need to be shown.  Both need consistent, kind guidance, with positive reinforcement of good behavior. Take potty training.  First, your toddler sees what you do on the toilet.  Then you sit her on the potty, and wait patiently through many sessions until she poos or pees. When it finally happens, you reward that desired behavior with praise, and in the case of my daughter who loved band-aids, a pink band-aid stuck on her arm. You repeat that cycle for more sessions until she gets the hang of it. My daughter who loved bandaids as a potty-training treat, hated time-outs.  No surprise, as time-outs are a punishment.  But she really hated them. When we put her in the chair, she would jump back out, until we strapped her in. When we turned her to face away, she would kick at the wall to knock her and the chair over.  After a few scares, we kept the chair just far enough away. Time-out is another action-based training technique useful for teaching toddlers and dogs (and hockey players).  Instead of giving a positive reinforcement like treats or praise, time-out removes positive reinforcements from the trainee to show that a specific behavior is not desired. Most parents use time-outs, and they are much more effective than harsh punishments like spanking.  However, a recent study in the journal Academic Pediatrics reported that 85% of parents do at least one time-out technique incorrectly.  64% made multiple mistakes.  Such errors included talking with the child while he was in time-out, giving multiple warnings before time-out, and allowing him books, computers, or toys while in. To be most effective, you must remove all interesting interactions from time-out, including facing a wall so there’s nothing to look at. The child should be put in immediately for bad behavior, no warnings.  Multiple warnings only teach toddlers that they have multiple chances at bad behavior before punishment. Place the child in with minimal emotional input- a firm voice telling them simply why she’s in time-out, no embellishments or scolding.  If your child wants to deny it or start arguing, ignore that.  Your toddler wants conversation and attention, so silence between you and him is the rule.  And no toys or screens in time-out- it’s supposed to be no fun! Time-out should last one minute per year of age: 2 year-olds get 2 minutes, 3 year-olds 3 minutes, etc. Finally, all training, whether positive reinforcements with rewards, or time-outs with removal of rewards, requires consistency.  Li ke we mentioned above, dogs and toddlers don’t really “speak english;” they don’t understand the meaning of words.  Meaning must be taught by action, again and again, until it sticks.  And the amount of persistence equals the amount of good behavior you can expect from your toddler.  Or your dog!

Jacob had no chance.  He couldn’t catch me that day, and from then on the boys let me play as an equal. This story raises the issue of young girls in athletics.  Multiple studies demonstrate that fewer girls participate in sports.  That number drops off even more once girls hit puberty. There are myriad reasons cited, including disinterest, teasing, body changes, lack of female athlete role models, and believing boys will like them less.  The sports drop-out rate for girls around adolescence is six times greater than for boys.  Only a quarter of high school girls are in sports, compared to over half of high school boys. When we lose these girls to culture and peer pressure, they in turn lose valuable opportunities: to gain self-confidence, leadership experience, and of course better health. The science is clear that sports and fitness activities stave off obesity and heart disease, substance abuse and depression, and even lower rates of teen pregnancy. Participating girls tend to go on to have better lives, including chances at college scholarships, and better professional development. Gender equality in physical activity starts in grade school.  Girls need to know that they have a right to enjoy sports, to feel strong and have fun playing.  This includes the right to that recess playground and the chance to run like the wind, even if she’s wearing a blue dress with flowers on it. The Olympics in Rio last summer showcased many elite female athletes. Simone Biles won five gold medals in gymnastics, including the best and most fun floor exercise in a long time. Then on NBC’s Today show, she even eclipsed her celebrity crush, actor Zac Efron. He was invited on to surprise the gymnast and her team, but he was clearly awed himself. “They won gold medals, they were crushing it the entire Olympics,” explained Efron, “and I was like hiding in a closet waiting to come in.” Like we discussed above, more girls need to be in athletics, having fun, staying fit, and living their own great moments.  It’s even better when girls play multiple sports, instead of being single-sport “specialty” athletes. However, kid sports have evolved to nurture hopes of creating stars. Sport-specific camps and select leagues provide opportunities for kids to slog away at one sport year-round.  Parents believe they’re doing their kids a service with the extra practice time and experience, grooming them for futures in the major leagues. In fact, the data shows the exact opposite. Children who are channeled into single sports often burn out by high school. Not only do they get bored playing one sport, but injuries increase significantly.  We see these kids in the Emergency Department, when after going through the same motions year after year, they get worn-out, swollen and painful joints.  That’s no path to success. In fact, coaches like Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, and Brian Kelly prefer and actively scout multi-sport athletes. Most NFL quarterbacks played more than one sport in high school and college. Changing sports broadens a kid’s peer group- more friends, more fun. Multi-sport kids get more overall fitness, training different muscles necessary for each sport.  And switching joint use spreads out the strain. Finally, kids get less bored not having to throw a zillion pitches day after day, if they get to tumble in the gym instead. Next time, instead of enrolling your child in another select league, maybe encourage her to try a different sport that season. Who knows, maybe a miniature Alex Morgan will come out on the soccer field, having been hidden behind mediocre T-ball skills. Posted in Play time , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply Modern Adventures for Kids Posted on February 26, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply In 2008, New York City mom Lenore Skenazy was shopping with her 9 year-old son.  They rode the subway, and that day he begged her to let him ride home alone.  Ms. Skenazy decided it was time for some independence and let him.  He returned home safely and was ecstatic with his feat.  But when Ms. Skenazy wrote about it in a newspaper column, she set off a storm of controversy. Some called her the “world’s worst mom,” and child protection agencies took note.  Others praised her for not being afraid to give her child freedoms not allowed by  “helicopter parents,” so-called because they hover over their kids’ every move.  Ms. Skenazy recently completed a reality TV series where she coached such parents on letting their kids ride bikes or slice vegetables, to give the kids some independence.  The show’s title: World’s Worst Mom. In the Pediatric Emergency Department, we often roll our eyes at what some kids are allowed to do- ride 4-wheelers or use the microwave.  But we only see the kids who get hurt; scads of kids use microwaves without spilling boiling water on themselves, and jump on trampolines without breaking something.  The key is teaching children to do these things safely. Before Ms. Skenazy let her 9 year-old ride the subway alone, she had coached him on reading subway maps and identifying uptown versus downtown trains.  It’s the same with kids doing any risky thing, like riding bikes or 4-wheelers.  There’s rules and training before setting your kid loose. Of course, learning to ride a bike requires teaching; kids can’t just get on and ride.  But the safety stuff requires more parenting- teaching the rules of the road and enforcing helmet use.  When my son wanted to ride to his friend’s house miles away, we went riding together to show how to stay on the right side of the road and cross busy streets safely, and to be sure he knew the way.  And we had him call when he arrived so we could relax. When I was eight years-old, they built a hospital near my house.  Construction sites are as good as Disneyworld to a child: piles of dirt to play on, and those big yellow machines!  Fortunately the workers took the keys out of the bulldozer; otherwise we would have fired it up and gone for a spin. One day I ran across the site and into a mud patch.  It was deep enough that I sank to my knees, stuck.  Remembering the quick-sand scenario in movies, I was scared that I might sink more.  I yelled to my buddy, but he stood helplessly at the edge of the patch, no rope or stick handy to save me.  Since no other rescue was likely, I decided I had to save myself and began to slog my way to a big rock nearby.  Three or four heaves in that direction and I was able to hug the rock and haul myself out. Parents worry about letting their kids out into the world.  If my folks had known about that deep mud, would they have let me go to the site?  Perhaps not, but back then things seemed safer.  There wasn’t 24-hour cable news, needing to fill a whole day with attention-grabbing stories to scare parents.  Every child abduction in the country now gets breathless attention.  Before cable and internet there were only brief TV news programs and newspapers; no space to report every child tragedy in the nation. In reality, back then children were actually less safe.  Crime was rising in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1993.  Now there is 50% less crime than when I was a kid.  In addition to a more dangerous environment, kids went out without cell phones or bike helmets.  So the world turns out to be pretty safe for kids; the odds that your kid will be kidnapped or seriously hurt are very tiny. And children yearn for freedom.  They want to explore, push boundaries, and be proud of their accomplishments.  Lenore Skenazy’s boy was beside himself with joy at going home alone on the New York subway.  While many think that’s extreme, even the FAA lets 14 year-olds fly gliders solo.  Makes a bike ride across town seem pretty tame. Posted in ATV safety , Bike and Trampoline Safety , Play time | Leave a reply Play Time Is Serious Business! Posted on October 3, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply I often pick a column topic based on what I am seeing a lot at the Pediatric Emergency Department here at Lafayette General.  Lately we have been seeing lots of unhappy kids- suicidal teenagers, violent grade schoolers, children with anxiety and panic attacks.  Even minor things like cars backing into each other in parking lots become blown up: parents and their kids feeling victimized in these accidents and exaggerating their neck and back pain. Pick up any newspaper or listen to a news report and you will hear the same.  It is a national trend that people are unhappier, using more antidepressant medication, attempting suicide more, and of course there are more and more mass shootings.  What happened to easy-going kids and adults?  It seems that kids once handled adversity better, took losses with good grace, negotiated well with others, and generally were happier with their lot in life.  Many researchers are beginning to believe that a lot of these problems in kid and adult functioning are partly because of an erosion in the amount of time kids are allowed to play. Really?  Loss of play time leads to unhappy kids and adults? Play has been called “the work of childhood.”  Play is more important to a child’s development than homework.  Lion cubs play at hunting so they can learn to hunt and eat and survive as adult lions.  Kids need play to practice what humans do as adults- interact well and handle life in complex society.  For lion cubs and kids to play, of course, it has to be fun.  No kid wants to “play” corporate board meeting or how to settle a lawn mowing dispute with their neighbor.  But if you think about it, isn’t this what they are learning when they play Monopoly? What is the best kind of play?  Researchers are finding that the best play is kid-driven, kid directed: simple games that are fun, with the rules regulated by the kids themselves: games like tag and pick-up baseball, doll houses and board games, imaginary play as explorers and heroes.  These are games where kids play face to face and talk through the rules and parameters themselves.  When kids run the game and make it fun, they end up practicing adult life skills. Organized sports and computer games do not fit the bill when it comes to making mature, capable kids.  The problem with organized sports is that they are adult-regulated, which automatically takes a lot of the fun out.  Adults make the rules and settle the disputes while the kids mope around the dugout waiting for a brief turn at bat.  Adults tell the kids how they should act or behave instead of the kids trying out how to act and behave between themselves. In computer and video games, the game program sets the rules and runs the play.  Sure they are fun, but the fun is transient and superficial, continual brief episodes of a “fun high.”  Playing video games is the psychological equal of eating candy- something that is nice once in awhile, but not something kids should do all day.  No lessons are learned in video games except how to run the controller better and better. The life lessons learned in real play time are life-long.  How to take a skinned knee without being a victim.  How to lose gracefully.  How to live with disappointment and carry on with a smile. Of course, kids don’t learn this right away.  There are tantrums and kicking over the checker board and storming away.  But if kids want to continue to have fun and play with others, they have to control those childish actions.  And when they practice controlling their childish urges as kids, that control is “hard-wired” in them by the time they are adults. So adults, let’s protect our kids’ play.  Limit the computer games.  Allow every opportunity for your kids to play with others.  Encourage your schools to keep recess.  Cut back on organized sports- your kid is not going to end up playing for the Yankees or the Saints anyway.  But she will probably have to negotiate a bank loan, and how can she do that if she hasn’t played Monopoly? Special thanks to Daniel Yeager, a child therapist here in Lafayette, for ideas and input.

Mom’s in the yard when her 5 year-old son Logan runs over. “Something bit me,” he cries, “it hurts!”  Blood drips down his arm.  He’s rushed inside and while mom washes the arm in the kitchen sink, the story comes out.  Logan was next door at his friend Tommy’s, when they saw some animals in the bushes. They went to get a closer look, and Logan got bitten. It was a small animal, that looked to Logan like a rat. Just then Tommy’s mom calls to check on Logan, and that she saw ferrets in the bushes lately.  ”It was a ferret!” chimes in Logan, “One of the teachers at school has one in her classroom!”  A ferret and a bleeding bite wound, mom thinks, what do I do now? Go to the Emergency Room?  Call Animal Control? Both are good ideas. Any time an animal bites and breaks the skin, the child is at risk for infections.  The bite can cause other problems too- disfiguring scars, tendon and nerve damage, and pain.  Your first step is doing just what Logan’s mom did- wash the wound. This rinses out harmful bacteria and viruses that might cause infection. Some bleeding is good- blood washes bacteria out too.  After a good washing, stop the bleeding with direct pressure. Call Animal Control.  The animal should be captured and quarantined to see if it has rabies.  This goes for pets, stray animals, and wild animals- any mammal can carry rabies, and rabies is deadly! Then at the Emergency Room, the team can further clean the wound, assess for infection and damage, prescribe an antibiotic, and consider if rabies vaccine is necessary.  Though deep lacerations are usually stitched, this isn’t always the case with bites.  While face bites are often sutured to minimize scarring, wounds on hands, arms, legs, and feet are commonly left open to continue to drain.  Stitching those increases the risk of infection by trapping bacteria inside.  Finally, the child’s tetanus vaccine status is assessed. Tetanus is another deadly infection, and kids who aren’t up to date need a booster. Preventing animal bites is the best way to avoid complications like above.  Consider what your child watches on TV and in movies concerning animals.  Most animals in kid shows talk, are friendly, and are really cute.  These shows inadvertently teach your kids that animals are pretty much all great.  So, they might think, why not play with every real animal they see? Well, in real life wild animals are more like people in a big city- some are mean, some have nasty infections, some bite.  You wouldn’t want your kid going up to every stranger and touching them, would you?  Thus you need to teach them to be wary of animals too. Even a neighbor’s dog that you don’t know well may be skittish with strangers, and bite when confronted. Caution with animals is particularly important given the nastiness of animal bite infections. The scariest of these is rabies.  Rabies is a fatal viral infection.  It infects the brains of animals, causing them to be very aggressive, and attack other animals and humans. Rabies is passed along in the biting animal’s saliva, and all infected animals eventually die. Likewise with humans, rabies just about always kills.  There have only been 13 known survivors in history, compared to 65,000 deaths worldwide per year. So which kid needs rabies prophylaxis?  Factors include prevalence of rabies in your region, if the child’s skin was broken by a bite (bad) or paw scratch (less bad), and of course- could the offending animal be carrying rabies? Domestic animals can have rabies- not all have had rabies vaccines.  Wild animals are at high risk of carrying rabies, particularly bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. And these wild animals can bite and transmit the virus to pets. So as we said above, if your child is bitten, call Animal Control.  They can help you and the doctor decide the risk of rabies.  In the best case, they can capture the animal, take it into quarantine, to see if it develops rabies.  If the animal turns rabid, your child can start the vaccines.  If the animal turns out to be safe, so is your child.

Posted on June 3, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Kevin Morris, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. My wife and I sit down to enjoy dinner with our boys- the three year-old in a booster and the 8 month-old in a high chair.  We are chatting and relaxed when the baby quits making sounds.  He had inhaled to cough and sucked in a piece of teething biscuit, completely blocking his airway!  I pulled him out of his high chair and used three quick back blows taught in basic rescue classes.  The piece popped out and tragedy was averted. Most people understand the danger of non-food items causing choking, like coins or rocks, but any object in the mouth is a hazard.  This is especially true for infants and children, who explore with their mouths and aren’t careful about chewing. The National Safety Council Injury Facts 2016 reports that choking is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death. What to do?  First and foremost every adult, parents or not, should take a Basic First Aid/CPR course.  In these you’re taught important life-saving maneuvers, including the Heimlich maneuver.  There are different techniques to use depending on the child’s age, and you practice hands-on.  Call the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, or your local Fire/EMS for a class, or navigate their websites. The most obvious way to avoid a choking episode is to make sure there aren’t small, non-food items within the child’s reach.  This includes marbles, rocks, small toys like lego pieces, button batteries, etc.  ”Within reach” is a big place for a toddler- they explore by crawling and walking wherever they can.  Since their mouths are one of the most sensitive parts of their bodies, they lick and taste new things they find, and pop them inside for a really good going-over. Thus to keep children safe from choking, parents, grandparents, and other sitters need to be diligent.  Caregivers should periodically get on their hands and knees and explore the house and yard like a toddler would- finding and cleaning up all small things that the child might ingest.  You can look on-line for all sorts of other ways to “toddler-proof” their world. Keeping non-food items out of your child’s mouth is one thing; but food is also a choking hazard.  My boy, who choked on the teething biscuit as a baby, had a second episode when he was 5 years.  When we were leaving a restaurant he grabbed a peppermint from the bowl on the counter. Once in the car I was backing out of the parking space, looked over my shoulder, and saw a scared look on my son’s face.  His hands flew to his throat, the classic sign of choking.  Since he was older, the back blows I used when he was a baby were no longer appropriate.  I jumped out, grabbed him from his seat, and administered the Heimlich maneuver. After five abdominal thrusts the peppermint was expelled and my son was breathing again. Like we said above, prevention is the best medicine for choking.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding these foods for young children: hard candies like that peppermint, un-cut hot dogs, nuts, peanut butter chunks, popcorn, seeds, whole grapes.  You get the idea: any firm object large enough to block your child’s airway. Grapes are good for kids, they just need to be cut into halves or quarters.  Hot dogs need to be sliced.  Children don’t always chew food thoroughly, and aren’t yet able to reliably keep food from falling to the back of their throats. Another important rule is never let toddlers and small children walk and eat.  It’s hard for a kid to do both when they’re still new to those activities.  When kids walk, they breathe harder, chew less, and thus increase choking risk.  And when they’re walking, they can walk out of your sight and choke to death without you even knowing it! Therefore, all kids from infancy to elementary school should sit while eating, where they can be monitored by adults.  And as I have repeated, we highly recommend that every parent, caregiver, and babysitter take a BLS/First Aid course to have the skills to save a choking child.  Like I did twice with my son, you may save a life very important to you! Posted in Choking Hazards | Leave a reply Feeding New Babies New Foods Posted on March 13, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Nichole Miller, a family practice resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette.  Dr. Miller has a four-month old baby, and know of what she speaks : Brandon’s mom was excited, her baby is 6 months-old, sits up without much assistance, and is now interested in food.  Great!  What a big step in little guy’s development.  But now: “Which foods should I start with?  Is he really ready to eat foods?  What if he has food allergies?  Sheesh, why is it so complicated?” Every parent’s journey includes the exciting time of feeding foods for the first time.  This new adventure comes with those questions.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), babies are ready for solids when they can hold their heads up, sit with minimal support, and open their mouths to food.  Easy enough, right?  But again, what foods to start?  Start with simple puree foods, like baby cereals.  Vegetables should come before fruits.  No highly allergic foods, like foods containing peanuts or egg. Give one new food at a time and wait three days before introducing another new food.  This helps identify any food allergies your child may have- if baby starts with a bad rash, vomiting, or diarrhea after eating that new food, stop serving it.  If you give new foods too close together, you can’t know which one caused the rash. Let’s fast-forward: Brandon is now one year and his mom is at the next hurdle, the picky eater stage.  Every parent worries about picky eaters.  The AAP reminds parents that toddlers sometimes just aren’t hungry.  Brandon may eat all his breakfast and not touch lunch or dinner.  Instead of fighting about food, offer a variety of foods and let your toddler choose.  Whatever he doesn’t eat, offer it at the next meal.  Remember the four main food groups: meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, and breads and cereals.  Offer items from each group.  Avoid highly processed foods, which means foods which are highly packaged and have ingredients you can’t pronounce. That covers the “do’s” of feeding toddlers food, let’s talk about the “don’ts.”  Say Brandon still won’t eat any foods, only drinks milk.  Milk is good for a kid, right?  So mom feeds him all the milk he wants- four 8-ounce bottles per day.  Since he won’t eat meals, she lets him snack all day.  This is common with new parents and toddlers, and reveals three don’ts.  First, no bottles after one year- kids should drink from sippy cups.  Second, toddlers shouldn’t drink more than three 4-ounce cups of milk per day- more than that kills their appetite for foods, and filling up on milk robs a kid of important food nutrients.  Finally, snacking also kills appetites for meals, and snack-grazing behavior contributes to obesity. However, Brandons’ parents read our blog and he is eating a variety of foods and is doing great.  Now Brandon’s dad offers him grapes.  He eats one and begins to choke.  Mom panics, pounds him on the back, and he coughs up a barely-chewed grape.  Many small firm foods are choking hazards for toddlers because they don’t know how to grind their food while chewing.  The AAP recommends the following foods be avoided: un-cut hot dogs, hard candies, nuts, peanut butter chunks, popcorn, seeds, whole grapes, and the like.  Parents should take a CPR class to learn choking management like the Heimlich maneuver. Another food concern is eating things that aren’t food.  Say Brandon is now 7 years-old and in T-ball.  He just finished a game and is enjoying some sunflower seeds like real baseball players.  However, unlike the guys on TV, he is swallowing the shells with the seeds instead of spitting them out.  The next day, Brandon has terrible pain when pooping.  The pain gets so bad he’s brought to the Emergency Department.  On x-ray, we see the shells stacking up and forming an impaction in Brandon’s rectum.  Also, the shells’ sharp edges hurt like broken glass.  Brandon has to go the Operating Room to get the horrible impaction out. Parents, never let your kids eat sunflower seed shells- just the seeds please!  Leave the shell eating-and-spitting to the pros, who get paid to do that on TV. Posted in Choking Hazards | Leave a reply Throw Me Something Mister- I’ll Try Not To Swallow It! Posted on February 13, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Libby Going, a Family Medicine resident at the University Health Center here in Lafayette. Mardi Gras is here!  That means celebrating with floats and parades, king cakes…..and beads.  Edible treats quickly come to mind when we thing about Carnival season, but occasionally kids try things that are not edible. Part of baby development is learning about objects by putting them into the mouth.  The mouth is one of the most sensitive parts for babies, so they use it to explore their world as much as they can.  This means every parent has had to grab something inedible out of baby’s hand or mouth.  ”Don’t eat that!” or “That’s not food!” are common phrases for parents with small children. Many iconic Mardi Gras items have great appeal to a baby or toddler who already wants to put things in his mouth.  Sparkly, smooth, multi-colored beads, small plastic babies (looks just like me!) hidden in king cakes, and shiny gold doubloons- what more could a little one want?!? So how do we keep this natural behavior for kids from becoming a 911 call or Emergency Department visit?  First, many bakeries now help out by not putting the baby into the king cake before purchase.  Parents can decide to place the inedible object into the cake or not.  Please decide not!  Let’s face it- toddlers will at the very least lick it, and maybe eat it. An idea for the older child who “just has to have the baby” is to put the baby on top of her piece and then take it back soon after. Coins (or gold doubloons at this time of year) and button batteries are also favorites for trying in the mouth.  Thus you must be vigilant about not letting those in baby’s reach. Beads are also a serious choking hazard, so don’t be careless about leaving those around either.  But babies will be babies and sometimes just get ahold of these things, so it is important for parents to take a CPR class.  There you can learn the Heimlich maneuver, which works great for choking and can be life saving. Even when Mardi Gras is over, kids will still put interesting things in their mouths and maybe swallow them.  If they do swallow something, and maybe gag and choke, this is one of the worst experiences in parenting!  This fear brings a lot of kids and their folks into the Emergency Department, even when the kid looks fine and swallowed something seemingly innocent. When a child has swallowed what we call a “foreign body,” he may have increased fussiness, only want to drink liquids, vomit, complain of throat or chest or abdominal pain, or have a different sounding cough or gagging noise.  With any of these signs, your child needs to be evaluated.  Button or disc batteries are particularly dangerous because even if your child seems fine after they swallow one, batteries can cause serious internal burns. We often use xrays to show the culprit and where in the body it is.  Even if the parent doesn’t know exactly what was swallowed, the object’s shape on xray can tell us what it is. Most foreign bodies pass harmlessly through the gastrointestinal tract and appear at the opposite end.  Sometimes a couple of xrays can be used to monitor the journey of that very interesting object.  However, some objects may require removal, usually by endoscopy.  This is a flexible fiberoptic tube with tiny tools and a light at the end, through which the doctor can see the thing and grab and retrieve it.  Some things that need to be removed include batteries and objects that are stuck and not moving through. One important note to remember is never give your child something to drink or a snack once you decide to bring him in.  Children need to have empty stomachs for surgery, to have anesthesia safely.  Also, trying to feed a child with a blocked esophagus can cause vomiting and further choking hazards. Mardi Gras can be a great time for the whole family, toddlers included, but some precautions must be taken to ensure that the fun does not end in the Emergency Department.  Laissez les bon temps rouler! Posted in Choking Hazards | Leave a reply He Put What In His Mouth?? Posted on September 5, 2013 by klfydoctor 3 The mom came in with the ambulance crew, sobbing “ She is so fast!” Her 2 year-old daughter was skipping past dad as he watched TV.  She grabbed a piece of his popcorn and before anyone could react, tossed it in her mouth.  She suddenly stopped skipping, a look of surprise on her face, and began gagging and coughing before settling down to a steady wheeze.  The parents called 911, and she was brought in still struggling to breath. The x-ray showed the popcorn in her windpipe, just below her vocal cords. It would take a surgery to reach down that far and get it out, so I made the calls and waited for the crew.  Meanwhile we stood by watching her struggle, not wanting to agitate her more, for fear that if she got more worked up, she could suck the popcorn further down and completely block her airway.  After an eternity of watching her breathe, watching her get more and more tired from the effort, the OR stretcher showed up.  Everything in surgery was ready, and off she went.  It took the surgeon a good hour to fish out the piece, but in the end the girl did well. Toddlers are choking episodes waiting to happen.  First, they like to explore the world, and they explore it most with their mouths.  Their mouths are the most sensitive things they have, so everything gets licked and tasted.  If the object of curiosity fits, they pop it in for a really good going-over.  Second, toddlers have zero good-judgement.  They know nothing about what is safe to put in their mouths.  Dimes, electrical cords, bees, whatever they can put in, they will. Finally, as we often say in this column, toddlers can not be watched every second of the day.  And they are doing potentially dangerous things all the time.  I myself have come home to the babysitter sobbing, “ She is so fast!” when my toddler daughter, without warning, ran over and kicked my infant son. There are some good rules for preventing choking episodes like happened with the girl above.  The first rule is not feeding your toddler unsafe foods.  Such foods are small, hard to chew, and too yummy for toddlers to pass up.  These are foods like candy, gum, nuts and seeds, hot dogs, hard meats, and small firm fruits and vegetables like raisins. Toddlers and infants haven’t got many teeth to properly chew up these foods to make them safe to swallow.  Toddlers also, like we said before, have lousy judgement about what to eat.  Who cares if that hard candy is a choking hazard and bad for their teeth?  If it tastes good and is in your purse, they will fight you for it just the same. Another good rule for toddler and infant eating is sitting down.  Small children should only be allowed to eat when they are sitting and being supervised.  No walking, playing, running, or lying down while eating.  Kids breathe harder and eat more carelessly when they are moving.  Just like the old joke about some adults being unable to walk and chew gum at the same time, toddlers can NOT safely walk and eat and breathe.  Not only are they safer sitting still when they are eating, but you can watch that only safe things are going in. All homes with infants and toddlers should be swept for choking hazards.  Get down on your hands and knees and crawl around everywhere at your child’s eye level.  Pick up small objects that your child could inhale- coins, marbles, deflated balloons, small toy parts.  Particularly dangerous are button batteries and magnets- both can cause deadly internal injuries if swallowed. Finally, all parents should take a CPR class to learn the Heimlich maneuver.  If our girl with the popcorn in her windpipe had suddenly stopped breathing, that would have been our best life-saving intervention.  The Heimlich is easy to learn, easy to do, and works great. So be careful about what foods you let your toddler eat.  Get down on your hands and knees and clean house.  And sit your kids down anytime they eat- that way you can know What He Put In His Mouth.

Posted on May 7, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply Today’s guest columnist is Dr. Asma Khan, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Whenever any couple has a newborn, their world changes completely!  Suddenly every decision is colored with thoughts of the child’s well-being.  It’s unavoidable and it’s beautiful.  But as the couple embarks on raising this new child, something less magical happens.  Meemaw, Nana, and Auntie Gertrude all have something to say about how he should be raised.  Much of the advice is good, but some is Old Wive’s Tales. I heard some Old Wive’s Tales this past month in the Pediatric Emergency Department. One baby had fever for a few days, and mom was feeding only pedialyte.  When I asked why, mom said that her doctor told her you shouldn’t give feverish babies formula because it curdles in their stomach and they vomit.  Now, this doctor is one of my colleagues in the Family Practice residency, so I emailed her.  The doctor in question swore up and down that she never says this, so mom probably got the advice from some other revered source (grandmother, perhaps???) and grafted it onto her doctor! This idea of milk curdling in children’s stomachs is a myth.  The thought is that when the child has fever, milk curdles because of the heat, just like milk curdles when heated on the stove.  The child then has indigestion and vomits.  In fact, there’s no reason to deny a fevered child milk.  If the child tolerates milk, by all means feed it!  Milk is a better fluid to give a sick child than water if she is refusing to eat, so she gets some nutrition. Now, your child may vomit when ill.  This is because of the illness itself, not because of milk.  Some infections cause vomiting, just like they cause fever or cough or diarrhea.  If your child vomits, then we stop milk.  Milk can be more difficult to hold down on an upset stomach.  With vomiting we advise to switch to clear liquids like pedialyte or sports drinks for 6 to 8 hours.  When the vomiting has stopped you can go right back to the milk. Do you know why kids hate to wear coats?  It’s because parents and grandparents insist that they wear one out in the cold.  ”You’ll catch a cold if you don’t bundle up, sweetie!” is a line we have all heard when we were kids. But to kids, coats are a pain to put on and encumbering when they play.  Also, some kids love to defy authority, so being told to put on a coat becomes the exact opposite of what they want to do! However, kids don’t “catch colds” because they didn’t wear a coat.  Winter viruses are not from the weather.  Coughs and runny noses are caused by viruses that you catch from another person, and a coat doesn’t prevent that. Periodic hand-washing is much better prevention for the common cold.  Having a coat on in the winter keeps you comfy, but your child running around the backyard is already pretty warmed up.  Let him run free for a bit and then make sure he cleans up before sitting down to that stew. “Feed a cold, starve a fever” is another Old Wive’s Tale, that dates back to the 1500s. The belief was that eating warmed up the body, while not eating cooled it down.  Thus “starving” was felt to be a way to control fever.  Likewise if baby had a “cold,” you wanted to feed baby to warm it up.  This is all a myth and the saying should be “feed your child,” period.  Fever is not the main ailment, it’s one of the body’s natural responses to fight infection.  When your child has fever, it’s a message to you to feed him as much (or as little!) as he wants, so he has the strength to get healthy. These are a few tips as you go along the beautiful and scary journey of parenthood.  If other family member’s advice sounds dubious, check with a professional source when it comes to your child’s health.  If it’s the best chocolate cake recipe you’re after, always listen to Meemaw or Nana or Auntie Gertrude! Posted in Parental Fears | Leave a reply Ghost Stories vs. Rational Worries Posted on January 5, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply Occasionally I am surprised by some parent’s beliefs.  There are a lot of “old wive’s tales” out there which I am used to: fever curdles milk in baby’s stomachs, fever will cook baby’s brain, blowing cigarette smoke in ears is good for ear pain, etc.  One day, however, a mom asked me “do cats really steal babies’ breath?”  I had a millisecond hesitation that a mom could really believe that, but recovered and answered the question like this: Cats like to sleep in warm places, and I am sure some time in the past a cat jumped into a newborn’s crib, snuggled up to the warm infant, and accidentally smothered it.  This is how crib death happens- baby smothers by rolling face down in thick bedclothes or a pillow and is not mature enough to be able to roll back.  Once the cat did this, the act became myth- that cats, already associated with the supernatural, have the ability to ”suck” the life out of babies like in horror movies. It is natural for people to try to explain how things happen, and make the explanation more supernatural and exciting.  When it comes to child care the explanations sometimes become too exciting and lead to needless anxiety.  One of the main reasons I write this blog is to help parents separate the wild fears that bring them to the Emergency Department from the real worries. Here is a quick list of things NOT to worry about, in addition to those already mentioned: children hitting their heads and dying after a long interval of looking well, children choking to death on blood from bloody noses, babies choking to death on mucus, babies and children choking to death on vomit, swallowing tongues during seizures, spotty rashes being measles.  For further explanations of these, look to the appropriate Category on the right of this blog page. Real trouble looks like this: children getting increasingly lethargic and unresponsive, breathing hard and fast, head injury with loss of consciousness and vomiting, fever in a baby under two months old.  These are the right reasons to go to an Emergency Department, rather than because baby has rattling breathing from a runny nose. Of course, when in doubt call your doctor.  They can help you separate the real worry from the wild fear over the phone.  And besides not sleeping with baby in your bed, keep the cat out of the room too.

Some called her the “world’s worst mom,” and child protection agencies took note.  Others praised her for not being afraid to give her child freedoms not allowed by  “helicopter parents,” so-called because they hover over their kids’ every move.  Ms. Skenazy recently completed a reality TV series where she coached such parents on letting their kids ride bikes or slice vegetables, to give the kids some independence.  The show’s title: World’s Worst Mom. In the Pediatric Emergency Department, we often roll our eyes at what some kids are allowed to do- ride 4-wheelers or use the microwave.  But we only see the kids who get hurt; scads of kids use microwaves without spilling boiling water on themselves, and jump on trampolines without breaking something.  The key is teaching children to do these things safely. Before Ms. Skenazy let her 9 year-old ride the subway alone, she had coached him on reading subway maps and identifying uptown versus downtown trains.  It’s the same with kids doing any risky thing, like riding bikes or 4-wheelers.  There’s rules and training before setting your kid loose. Of course, learning to ride a bike requires teaching; kids can’t just get on and ride.  But the safety stuff requires more parenting- teaching the rules of the road and enforcing helmet use.  When my son wanted to ride to his friend’s house miles away, we went riding together to show how to stay on the right side of the road and cross busy streets safely, and to be sure he knew the way.  And we had him call when he arrived so we could relax. When I was eight years-old, they built a hospital near my house.  Construction sites are as good as Disneyworld to a child: piles of dirt to play on, and those big yellow machines!  Fortunately the workers took the keys out of the bulldozer; otherwise we would have fired it up and gone for a spin. One day I ran across the site and into a mud patch.  It was deep enough that I sank to my knees, stuck.  Remembering the quick-sand scenario in movies, I was scared that I might sink more.  I yelled to my buddy, but he stood helplessly at the edge of the patch, no rope or stick handy to save me.  Since no other rescue was likely, I decided I had to save myself and began to slog my way to a big rock nearby.  Three or four heaves in that direction and I was able to hug the rock and haul myself out. Parents worry about letting their kids out into the world.  If my folks had known about that deep mud, would they have let me go to the site?  Perhaps not, but back then things seemed safer.  There wasn’t 24-hour cable news, needing to fill a whole day with attention-grabbing stories to scare parents.  Every child abduction in the country now gets breathless attention.  Before cable and internet there were only brief TV news programs and newspapers; no space to report every child tragedy in the nation. In reality, back then children were actually less safe.  Crime was rising in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1993.  Now there is 50% less crime than when I was a kid.  In addition to a more dangerous environment, kids went out without cell phones or bike helmets.  So the world turns out to be pretty safe for kids; the odds that your kid will be kidnapped or seriously hurt are very tiny. And children yearn for freedom.  They want to explore, push boundaries, and be proud of their accomplishments.  Lenore Skenazy’s boy was beside himself with joy at going home alone on the New York subway.  While many think that’s extreme, even the FAA lets 14 year-olds fly gliders solo.  Makes a bike ride across town seem pretty tame. Posted in ATV safety , Bike and Trampoline Safety , Play time | Leave a reply Dorkapotamus On A Bike Posted on May 16, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply Summer is coming.  I last wrote about swimming safety, and two more popular summer activities for kids need to be addressed: biking and jumping on trampolines. Bike safety is nothing new to me.  I grew up with a Dad who was a cycling nut, and a  safety nut.  When I was a kid, helmets for cyclists had not been invented yet.  One day my genius brother Pat, future MIT graduate, decided to see how far he could ride with his eyes closed.  He got as far as the back of a parked car.  After that Dad got us all hockey helmets for riding long distances. I grew up in a small town, and would ride to and from friend’s houses at night all summer.  It was pretty safe, what with no traffic and no crime, but Dad was taking no chances.  I had to ride with a head light, tail light, flashing light on the saddlebag, and reflectors front, back and sides.  I also had a light that strapped to my leg that shone out front and back.  I was lit up like an ambulance. Dad was a stickler for the Rules Of The Road.  We went on a lot of “bike hikes,” 25 to 50 miles each, with the Boy Scouts and as a family.  We always rode on the right side of the road.  We obeyed all stop signs and traffic signals.  We rode single file, to stay out of the way of cars.  No one ever got hurt, and we would celebrate the end of the 50 mile ride by splashing into the local river. I had a ten-speed for distances, but it wasn’t great for riding around the neighborhood with friends and popping wheelies.  So my brothers built me a “chopper” bike from junk yard parts, with a ripped-up banana seat and high handle bars.  One day a pedal came off and I spilled onto the asphalt.  After that, Dad trained us on better bike maintenance.  We did not ride when it was wet either, after the day I had sped down a hill, hit a wet patch in a turn, and skidded on my back onto a neighbor’s lawn. Though I looked like a real Dorkapotamus On A Bike back then, the safety issues still stand.  Wear a helmet.  Obey the same road rules as a car.  Be visible at night.  Ride a well-maintained bike.  And jump into the river at the end of a good hot day. Besides biking, trampolines are another fun summer activity for kids.  However, we are seeing a lot of injuries from trampolines- broken bones, head and neck injuries, hurt ankles and knees.  There are so many trampoline injuries that the American Academy of Pediatrics recently discouraged parents from having one at home. One of my pediatric nurses thinks differently.  He has five kids, and they absolutely love their trampoline.  When their first trampoline was blown apart by a hurricane, they mourned its loss for months, moping about, whining that there was now “nothing to do.”  This past Christmas he surprised them with a new one, and it was the best Christmas ever.  Now that its warmer and the sun comes up sooner, his kids get up an extra half hour early just to get some jumping in before school. Like bikes, trampolines are fun, but some rules need to be followed.  Only one kid should be allowed on at a time.  Lots of injuries happen when kids fall on each other, knock each other off, or ”double bounce.”  A double bounce, where one kid is falling while another kid is jumping, can generate enough force to break the legs of the falling child. Trampolines should be on level ground and away from trees and other obstacles.  A tilted trampoline will shoot a kid off to the side and on to the ground.  Obstacles offer something hard for the falling kid to get hurt on.  There should not be gaps between the rubber and the frame for kids to fall through.  No one is sure if netting around the trampoline saves kids from injury, but it seems like a good idea.  Square trampolines may be safer than round ones because of differences in the physics of the mat. Like we said last time about pools, not having a trampoline is safest.  But like bikes, a lot of kids just have to have one.  Like bikes, be sure your kids follow the rules.  We in Pediatric Emergency Medicine would like a quiet summer.

Minutes later she came back, finding baby against one of the blanket rolls face- in, pale and limp.  She screamed for her husband to call 911, snatched up baby, and began rescue breaths.  When the paramedics arrived, the infant was breathing. When they got to me in the Emergency Department, baby was still groggy but awake, and we all heaved a sigh of relief.  And shuttered to think, what if mom had been another few minutes….. October is SIDS Awareness Month.  SIDS is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, sometimes called crib death, wherein babies are put down to sleep and found dead.  In the last 50 years it was surmised that many of these deaths were from smothering, babies often being found face down in thick bedclothes.  Two decades ago the American Academy of Pediatrics began it’s Back-To-Sleep campaign, encouraging parents to put their babies to sleep on their backs.  The SIDS death rate plummeted. Since then we’ve found other factors in crib deaths.  When my kids were infants, my pediatric-nurse wife and I put them to bed on their backs, but on sheepskin, with bumper pads in their cribs.  We also placed stuffed animals with them.  My kids survived, but those things are now on the danger list too. Sheepskins, bumper pads, quilts, plush toys, and pillows are all smothering risks. One risk for SIDS that has been known for centuries is co-sleeping, or sleeping in the same bed or couch with baby.  Even medieval societies recognized this smothering risk. Germany had a law in the year 1291 forbidding women from taking children under 3 years-old into bed.  In 1862, the English Women’s Journal warned, “Nor must we forget a frequent and lamentable cause of death that in which the infant is “overlaid” in its slumbers by a careless, perhaps drunken nurse or mother.” SIDS Awareness Month in October coincides with another fall tradition, Halloween.  In this spirit, doctors at Montreal Children’s Hospital invented a training tool they called the Crib Of Horrors.  They placed a CPR baby mannequin in a crib with numerous safety hazards, and held a contest wherein staff from different units (Emergency Department, ICU, clinics, etc) would name as many violations as they could find.  The winner was the team that found the most hazards. They included several things we discussed above: piles of blankets near baby’s head that he could smother in, loose pajamas that could cover baby’s face, and other articles in the crib that could suffocate.  There were also more hospital-specific violations, like coils of oxygen tubing that could strangle a rolling baby. The Crib Of Horrors illustrates mistakes that parents often make when putting infants to bed.  Though it looks cozy, a crib with heavy blankets or quilts, stuffed animals, pillows, and bumper pads is unsafe.  And like the oxygen tubing, strings that hold pacifiers, or necklaces, are strangling risks. Babies should sleep in on their backs, face-up, in a thin, one-piece sleeper, on a thin mattress with a fitted sheet. Pacifiers have recently been shown to be protective against SIDS, so they’re okay.  But no strings attached. When babies get colds, they become noisy breathers, rattling and snorting at night, occasionally gagging and vomiting mucus.  Parents become worried that baby may choke to death on secretions (which actually is NOT a SIDS risk).  To watch baby more closely, they violate the cardinal rule about not bringing baby into bed with them.  Unfortunately, “watching baby” often becomes “sleeping with baby.” Like we mentioned above, the smothering hazards of “co-sleeping” with infants has been recognized for centuries.  We recommend “co-rooming”, where baby sleeps in a crib next to parent’s bed.  Thus baby is watched without being in the adult’s bed where pillows, blankets, thick mattresses, and the adults themselves become smothering risks. Cozy does not equal safe when it comes to sleeping babies.  Keep infants on their backs, even if they have colds- babies are designed to handle congestion and reflexively keep their airways clear lying face-up.  Be sure your infant’s bed doesn’t become a Crib Of Horrors. Posted in Newborn Sleeping Safety | Leave a reply Rockabye Baby.  Safely. Posted on October 8, 2014 by klfydoctor 1 We see a lot of little babies in the Emergency Department when they get their first colds. They cough and are congested, have noisy breathing, gag and hack on mucus, and sleep miserably.  When I talk to the parents about what to do, I ask, “So where does baby sleep?”  I usually get a sheepish look and a guilty smile and mom admits, “with me.” Then I take the opportunity to talk about sleep safety and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).  I talk about how baby should sleep on his back and be in his own crib or bassinet, how sleeping in bed with others is a smothering risk.  The parent often says that when baby is sick, they bring him in bed with them so they can watch that he is okay. Yes, I go on, that seems to make sense, but is the exact wrong thing to do with a sick baby. October is SIDS Awareness Month.  The CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and many other experts are getting the word out- keep baby safe!  SIDS happens when babies suffocate while sleeping.  They smother when they are face down in thick bed clothes or regular mattresses.  They smother when in parents’ bed by getting their faces stuck up against heavily sleeping adults, or when they slip between the mattress and a wall. Napping with babies on couches is dangerous too- there is even less room for the adult and a clear space for babies’ faces, and the cushions are even softer and easier to smother in.  Babies can also smother in their own cribs if there is too much soft stuff with them- thick blankets, sheep skins, stuffed animals, pillows, or bumper pads. When babies gets their faces into something too soft to breathe through, they suffocate. And babies under 6 months old cannot rescue themselves.  They do not have enough arm control to push away from a smothering situation.  They can’t do a push-up when face down on a thick mattress, blanket, or pillow.  They can’t roll over purposefully yet. Their brains and nervous systems aren’t mature enough for such maneuvers. What about our mom from above who brings her congested baby into her bed to watch him? If she is watching baby, doesn’t that protect him from smothering?  Unfortunately not. Too often “watching baby” becomes “sleeping with baby.” You’ve seen the old comedy routine in movies or on TV, where the character must stay awake to watch something, only to be overcome by sleep, and then be caught snoozing.  Well, this happens in real life when mom and baby are warm and snug in bed together. This is one of those cases where what seems better is shown by science to actually be worse.  Statistics show that sharing the bed with babies is much more dangerous, particularly when they are sick.  So how do you watch baby without sharing the bed? Pull that bassinet up next to your bed!  That way baby is safe in his own crib, and you can watch him from your bed. Here are the rules then, to prevent SIDS.  As above, baby sleeps in her own bassinet or crib. Baby sleeps on her back, face up.  Baby sleeps on a firm mattress that is specifically designed for babies.  Baby should sleep dressed in a onesie, so no pajamas shirts can ride up over her face.  If you must put a blanket in bed with baby, make it a thin one that is tucked in at the bottom of the bed, again to minimize the chance of it riding up over baby’s face.  And definitely no pillows, stuffed animals, or bumper pads. These things make baby’s bed cute, but they also are suffocation risks. Some moms try to compromise on baby position by putting their babies on positioners or “boppy” pillows.  Unfortunately, the safety of these has not been established.  So play it safe with baby, keep baby in his own bed with minimal padding.  Put baby to sleep on his back.  You and baby may be more restless on a given night, but in the long run you both will sleep much more soundly.  And safely. Posted in Newborn Sleeping Safety | 1 Reply Spread The Word: Babies Sleep On Their Backs! Posted on June 14, 2013 by klfydoctor 3 There has been an unusual number of crib deaths in Acadiana recently.  Crib death, or SIDS (for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) is a rare but devastating event where baby is found in bed dead for no apparent reason.  We in the Emergency Department hate these cases because there is nothing we can do when the baby comes in- our resuscitation efforts are far too late to help.  All we can do is help to get the word out to prevent these tragedies from happening. What happens in a SIDS case?  How does baby die?  To put it simply, the baby smothers to death.  They suffocate when they are face down in thick bed clothes, like pillows or soft mattresses.  They get caught with heavy blankets over their faces.  They get stuck under a heavily-sleeping adult.  Newborn babies and young infants do not have enough coordination and strength to rescue themselves from these situations.  They can’t do a push-up or roll over to recover from face-down smothering.  They can’t use their arms well enough to push blankets or pillows off their faces.  And they certainly can’t push an adult off themselves. In the past two decades, the American Academy of Pediatrics has been trying to get the word out so that parents can prevent these tragedies.  The campaign was first called “Back To Sleep,” meaning that babies should sleep on their backs, not on their tummies.  That way their faces stays clear of pillows and soft mattresses.  There should not be pillows, thick blankets, or stuffed animals in the baby’s bed- these are all smothering hazards.  Baby should not share a bed with adults, other children, dogs, or cats.  The old tale of cats stealing babies’ breath has some truth.  However, the cat does not “steal” the baby’s breath through some supernatural means.  They merely smother the babies when they snuggle up next to them for warmth and accidentally cover the babies’ faces. Many parents already know these rules, but break them when baby gets sick.  When baby spits up or has a cold, they bring baby into bed with them at night to “watch” them more closely.  Unfortunately, this “watching baby” becomes “sleeping with baby,” as the exhausted new parent finds it impossible to stay awake.  Then the parents and their soft beds becomes a suffocating risk. Parents also worry that colds and spitting up will clog babies’ airways.  It seems to make sense that when babies lie on their backs, they might choke to death on vomit or mucus.  So besides putting babies in bed with them, they are also tempted to put baby to sleep on their stomachs.  Again, this seems to make sense, as a baby who lies prone can let the secretions and vomit just run out their mouths. However, like many things in science, what seems to make sense turns out to be more dangerous.  Babies sleeping on their tummies doubles their risk of crib death, colds or vomiting or not.  Babies actually seem designed to handle vomit and secretions when they lie on their back.  Sure, they cough and gag and make choking sounds.  But these are the sounds of the reflex to clear their airways.  They cough out the secretions and gag but then swallow, and clear their airways themselves. So help us get the word out, since not every parent has heard or heeded the message: Babies should sleep on their backs.  They should sleep alone.  They should sleep on a firm surface with only thin blankets.  No pillows, stuffed animals, or crib bumpers.  And if you want baby closer to you at night, pull his or her bed up next to yours, but keep baby in that safe bed.  I am counting on you to do the right thing, and so is baby! Posted in Newborn Sleeping Safety | 3 Replies Go Back To Sleep, Baby Posted on April 6, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 When we bring a new baby home, we want to do everything to make our new family member comfortable.  We got a sheepskin as a shower gift- put it under baby!  Cover her with an extra blanket- don’t want her to get chilly.  Put some stuffed animals in the bed with her- it makes her so much cuter.  Uh oh she is crying- there, she is sleeping quieter now when I roll her on her stomach.  Still crying-I’ll bring her into bed with me. I’ve got to feed her in a half hour anyway. Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, everything I just mentioned doubles baby’s risk for crib death, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. SIDS is a rare but devastating event, where baby is found in bed dead for no apparent reason.  In the past two decades it has been discovered that crib death happens when babies smother.  Their faces get stuck in thick and soft bedding, or stuck under a heavily sleeping adult, and new babies don’t have the ability to roll over or do a push-up to save themselves.  In fact, babies really can’t save themselves until they can sit up on their own, which usually doesn’t happen until after 6 months of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics rolled out their “Back To Sleep” campaign 20 years ago.  The idea was to let every new family know that babies should sleep on their back.  Since then, the rate of crib death has fallen by 50%.  Besides having babies sleep on their backs, cribs should have no sheepskins, thick blankets, bumper pads, quilts, stuffed animals or toys, or pillows. Babies should sleep only in cribs.  Babies in beds get accidentally smothered by sleeping adults, or shoved to a corner where they get stuck between the bed and a wall.  Also, babies should not sleep on couches with adults.  My last crib death case happened when a father took a nap with his new baby on a couch, and when he woke up baby was dead, suffocated face down between him and the cushions. Finally, a lot parents are worried that if baby is on his back, he may choke on saliva or spit-up.  Not to worry!  Babies have been designed to handle spit up or mucus by coughing, gagging, and swallowing, to protect and clear the airway.  No baby with a normal brain and reflexes has died from choking on mucus or spit up. So put that baby Back To Sleep, on his back.  Feel free to use a pacifier- new evidence suggests that pacifiers are protective against SIDS, and help babies sleep quieter on their backs.  Resist the temptation to fill the crib with soft stuff you think will make baby more comfortable- that only makes it more dangerous.  Then after feeding baby at night, put him Back in his crib, where he belongs.

In the first week of medical school my class was split into groups of ten students with a professor.  The groups met weekly, between anatomy lessons and biochem lectures, to discuss doctor things like “how to use an otoscope,” and “how to scrub into a sterile OR.”  These were fun little breaks from the monotonous all-day lectures and hours spent studying. One of these forums was a little different. It was on “Breaking Bad News,” how to tell patients something terrible, like that they had cancer.  We role-played scenarios acting as patients and doctors, nervously laughing, as we practiced giving each other bad news.  We learned tips like “before giving bad news to a patient, turn off your phone,” and “don’t sugar coat anything, tell the whole truth,” and “allow the patient ample time for questions.”  It was an important exercise, and one we would revisit throughout training. Unfortunately there’s no handbook to prepare parents for receiving Bad News.  If only we were discharged from the hospital with our new baby in one hand and an indexed, tabbed, parenting handbook in the other.  I yearned for such a handbook when I was 20 weeks pregnant and on the parent side of Bad News.  My husband and I learned that our baby would be born with a complex heart defect that would require surgery.  Suddenly we were no longer researching car seats or deciding what color to paint the nursery.  We were talking about at which hospital to deliver this sick baby and planning for open heart surgery. Thankfully, in the Pediatric Emergency Department, the bad news usually goes: “Gage did, in fact, break his arm,” or “Liza looks like she has Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease, so no daycare for a few days.”  Occasionally the bad news is more serious, and here are some tips I’ve learned in my own experience. When presented with bad news, the most important thing to do is to select a “captain of the ship” for your child’s care.  You are wading into very unfamiliar and rocky waters, and you’ll want a doctor experienced in those seas.  When our baby was diagnosed with a heart defect, that doctor for my husband and me was our cardiologist, Dr. B, who could write a chapter on “breaking bad news.” When Dr. B made the diagnosis he made sure we were the only family in the office.  He sat us down, took out a sheet of paper, and drew her defect.  Then he wrote down two lists: one with an explanation of the defect, and the second on “where to go from here.”  It was our plan to refer to when we were confused or stressed.  Finally, we scheduled an appointment in a month to discuss further questions.  No matter what, you will need a good, reliable captain for the journey ahead. Another tip: resist the temptation to troll internet blogs; avoid late night Google searches.  My mom always told me in high school: “Nothing good comes from being out on the road after 10 pm.”  The same goes for Google!  Don’t get me wrong, there’s lots of good, useful information out there, but there’s a lot of bad information and horror stories too.  And while knowledge is power, I refer you to my first advice- ask your captain to give you good information and websites so you can properly educate yourself and advocate for your child. Try to meet other families facing similar diagnoses.  These days, social media is a wonderful tool to find support groups and families who are walking your same path.  Meeting others and knowing that you are not alone is a huge help.  You’ll be surprised how many locals are in a similar situation. Lastly, have a support system at home.  Lean on your spouse, family, and close friends.  If you live away from family, find a counselor, priest, or minister.  It’s imperative that you pay attention to your own needs in order to be able to take good care of your children.  And then when things go well like they did for us, you can celebrate good news!

Self-referrals are accepted, but it’s ideal for patients to be referred by their physicians or home health nurse, as primary care physicians and various specialists can easily handle most wounds. Lafayette General Health offers the people of Acadiana two locations to choose from – The Wound Care and Hyperbaric Healing Center at LGMC, or The Center for Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine at Acadia General Hospital (AGH) in Crowley. LGMC provides state-of-the-art diagnostic modalities to determine the reason that wounds are not healing and provides basic and advanced wound care according to what is needed to get a chronic wound to heal. Basic wound care principles include moisture and infection control, edema management and offloading or application of high and low tech wound care products. Advanced wound care technologies are available, such as wound vacuum-assisted closure, Apligraf® treatment, lymphedema pumps, total contact casting and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The advanced wound center at AGH is an outpatient program that focuses on chronic and non-healing wounds.  Using advanced treatment modalities and a case management model, AGH helps patients improve the quality of their lives. Problem wounds are often related to diabetes, chronic renal failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins. But, people without these problems can also develop non-healing wounds and need help. One of the most successful advanced healing modalities is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)? HBOT is the delivery of 100% oxygen under increased atmospheric pressure to the whole body to treat basic diseases and the processes that cause them.  The dose varies according to the particular disease or problem being treated. How is HBOT accomplished? Experienced physicians, nurses and hyperbaric technicians use pressurized chambers to administer treatments. Patients rest comfortably on a stretcher inside the chamber while they are slowly pressurized with pure oxygen, two or three times that of normal atmospheric pressure. They watch TV, rest or sleep while breathing healing oxygen. Patients can come out within a few minutes if there is an emergency. How long do HBOT treatments last? Treatments are usually given daily, Monday through Friday, for 20 to 30 treatments. Each treatment lasts about two hours from start to finish. What are the benefits of HBOT? HBOT activates leukocyte or white blood cell bacterial killing power. HBOT replenishes low-oxygen tissue with white blood cells to improve tissue growth. This method works better than topical oxygen or oxygen administered by mask or through the nasal passage. HBOT reduces edema (fluid build up in tissue) and inflammation, supporting cellular resuscitation and promoting healing of injured tissue. What types of conditions are treated with HBOT? HBOT helps heal injuries and wounds resulting in inadequate oxygen delivery anywhere in the body - from skin, internal organs, and brain and nervous system to bone. It is used most often in cases of threatened surgical flaps and skin grafts, complicated diabetic foot wounds, severe infections of bone or soft tissue, crushing injuries of extremities. It can also reverse tissue damage caused by radiation therapy, traumatic brain injuries and strokes. Is HBOT safe? Although any medical treatment has some degree of risk, all appropriate precautions are taken to ensure patient safety. Lafayette General’s hyperbaric chambers meet or exceed all federal, state and local guidelines. A specially trained hyperbaric physician evaluates all patients before treatments are prescribed. Physicians, nurses and technicians, all trained in hyperbaric medicine, attend all treatments.  HBOT offers great healing potential with minimal side effects. It is an excellent additional medical treatment for many patients who need extra help with the healing process. The treatment is painless, although some may experience temporary ear problems. Will insurance cover the treatments? Private, state and federal health insurance covers at least 13 medical conditions that respond to HBOT. These are primarily the conditions mentioned previously, plus decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning and certain exotic fungal and bacterial infections. Lafayette General Health will work out a plan to help you pay for treatments if you need them for a non-covered reason. Review our electronic brochure on Wound Care and Hyperbaric Healing .

It is designed to offer medical and/or necessary comprehensive rehabilitation services to patients whose needs cannot be met in an “inpatient hospital rehabilitation program,” or in the home setting. Staffed with experienced RNs, physical therapists, speech therapists, and occupational therapists, St. Martin Hospital’s Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Program is focused on improving patients’ functionality or medical condition before they return home. What sets us apart from most skilled nursing facilities is that our physician hospitalists provide 24-hour / 7-day coverage, rounding on patients daily. Specialists such as cardiologists and orthopedists, who have consulting privileges, are also available. For those patients requiring medical care and cardiac monitoring, we also offer the advanced service of telemetry with 24-hour monitoring, in eight of our inpatient beds. What’s more, our 24-hour Emergency Department is staffed with physicians trained in Emergency Medicine. They, along with a team of nurses, have been trained in advanced industry standards of care, including stroke treatment and cardiac protocols. These protocols provide for rapid treatment and transfer, if necessary. The hospital’s close proximity to Lafayette and central location in St. Martin Parish provides added convenience to patients and their families. Who qualifies? The majority of patients who have had a recent surgery of a general, orthopedic nature, and many other procedures for which additional care is needed to improve strength and wellness Patients who have been inpatients for three consecutive midnights Patients needing long-term IV treatments, such as antibiotics and nutrition Stroke patients needing rehabilitation services Patients debilitated or deconditioned after a long hospital stay Those with newly inserted feeding tubes qualify for a short stay in Skilled Nursing, with a focus on patient/family education Any patients needing physical, occupational, speech or respiratory therapy Patients requiring telemetry monitoring What does Medicare cover? In order for Medicare to pay for the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) program, specific qualifying medical criteria must be met, which includes: daily physical, occupational and/or speech therapy, intravenous (IV) or nutritional therapy, specialized care for complex wounds that are not healing well, pain management and end-of-life care. Following a hospital stay of at least three days, an individual must require either skilled nursing or skilled therapy services. Medicare will cover up to 20 days in full and up to 100 days with a co-payment as long as Medicare criteria are met. Medicare supplements will usually pay the deductible as long as Medicare continues coverage. Other medical insurance may cover a SNF program or a patient may pay with private funds.

But, this particular field of medicine is also closely associated with critical care medicine, and many pulmonologists are certified to practice both. Therefore, Lafayette General Medical Center (LGMC) staffs an ideally-suited team of these physicians in its emergency room and ICU. Each year, LGMC sees thousands of patients who suffer from various types of respiratory diseases. Our pulmonary patients are diagnosed and treated by the largest pulmonologist group in Lafayette, with the most combined experience in the area. These board-certified physicians treat a wide array of lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancers, pneumonia and fibroses. With vast experience in critical care, they also serve at LGMC intensivists, providing critical care 24 hours day, 365 days a years to all patients in Lafayette General’s 26-bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As intensivists, they are responsible for coordination of care of the ICU patients, equipment, facilities, programs, personnel and professional services necessary to the provision of ventilator care management in the ICU. Advanced Respiratory Testing Lafayette General was the first hospital in the state to use a proprietary molecular genetic technology to specifically test for respiratory infectious diseases. Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (Tem-PR) is a revolutionary nasal wash test that allows physicians to test for multiple infections, both viral and bacterial in as little as four hours. With this test, pulmonologists are able to quickly and more accurately diagnose a respiratory infection as well as co-infections, which may go undetected using more traditional testing. Reaching Lung Lesions We are now able to detect lesions on areas of the lung that were previously inaccessible. The advanced inReach lung navigation system gives access to the smaller branches of the lung, where cancers often begin. Using a minimally-invasive navigational catheter, pulmonologists are able to locate, test and plan treatment for lung lesions and lymph nodes that are difficult to access with a traditional bronchoscope. Lung Mass Clinic When a sizeable nodule or mass is detected on the lung, usually during an x-ray or CT scan, immediate attention is needed. That’s why Cancer Center of Acadiana at Lafayette General has created the Lung Mass Clinic - the only dedicated lung cancer screening center in Louisiana. Located in The Burdin Riehl Center, across from the hospital, the clinic is intended to give patients with suspect lung cancer a faster diagnosis and treatment. Pulmonologists The board-certified pulmonologists of LGH are some of the top physicians in the region, capable of addressing an array of conditions such as diseases of the lungs, exposure to toxins (smoke, fumes, etc.), reactions to infectious agents and autoimmune afflictions. Their adept skills are paired with the rich compassion and genuine bedside manner that you can expect from any LGH facility.

Posted on September 23, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Benjamin Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. It was mango season on Saba island, Netherlands Antilles.  My wife and I were on the beach eating some, and we decided to give our 8 month-old daughter a taste.  She liked it, but then paradise turned scary- she became lethargic, turned blue around the lips, was twitching, and seemed to stop breathing.  We called 911 and the island police rushed her to the local ER.  By the time we arrived, she was awake, pink, and breathing fine.  And now had a 103 degree fever. This was our first “febrile seizure,” and it had nothing to do with the mango.  Our daughter had an ear infection, which caused the fever, which led to the seizure. What is a febrile seizure?  Simply, it’s when a child has a seizure with a fever. The child suddenly goes unconscious, has rhythmic twitching of the face, arms or legs, and is unarousable.  The child’s breaths are so shallow that it’s hard to tell if they are breathing.  After a few minutes of seizing, the child relaxes and breathes normally, and though sleepy and confused-acting, can be aroused.  After 10 to 20 more minutes he becomes more awake. Febrile seizures only happen to about 4% of kids, but they sure are memorable when they do!  It’s frightening to watch, but doesn’t cause lasting harm.  Intelligence and other aspects of brain development aren’t affected- these kids grow up fine.  And kids do breathe adequately during seizures, although it’s tough to tell. More good news: most kids who have febrile seizures never have another.  About one third of these kids have more than one, but they all outgrow them by 6 years of age. Febrile seizures happen between ages 6 months to 5 years.  How high the fever goes, or how fast it goes up, has nothing to do with having a seizure.  Thus if your child has a fever of 104, that does not mean they’re going to seize.  Some kids seem to get them, most don’t.  In fact, seizures usually happen before the onset of fever, so if your child is already hot, it’s less likely that they’ll have one. During my second year of medical school, it happened again.  My daughter was 16 months at the time.  She was playing with the neighbor’s kids when she suddenly stopped, fell straight back on the floor, and began shaking.  The other mothers freaked out, but my wife assured them that it was “only a seizure.”  She sure got some strange looks!  Then the fever started, and it turned out to be another ear infection. As we discussed above, febrile seizures are scary to watch, but are actually no reason to panic.  They don’t hurt child’s brain, kids breathe adequately during the seizure, and go on to grow up fine.  Easy to say, but what do I do if my child has one? First, stay calm.  Roll the child onto his side, so if he won’t choke if vomiting. Don’t put things in the mouth.  Some people worry kids will “swallow their tongue” or bite their tongue, and think sticking something in will help- wrong!  Kids don’t choke during seizures, and shoving things in can hurt their teeth and mouth. Don’t try to stop the jerking either- you can’t, and again may hurt the child by trying. Watch the time.  Seizures lasting past 5 minutes may require treatment. If the seizure is going that long, call 911.  Paramedics carry medication that can stop seizures. Once the seizure is over, the child should see a doctor, to determine the source of the fever. Fevers are usually caused by viruses that go away by themselves, but sometimes kids have bacterial causes like ear infections, and need antibiotics.  Blood tests are mostly unnecessary after febrile seizures. Can you prevent febrile seizures?  Regular dosing with acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen don’t prevent them. Giving anti-seizure medication, like for kids with epilepsy, may help.  However, in most cases this is not recommended. Potential side effects of daily anti-seizure medications usually outweigh the benefits. Remember- febrile seizures are not harmful. The only danger is leaving kids in the bathtub unattended and they seize and drown.  But you shouldn’t leave kids alone in the tub anyway, seizures or not. Febrile seizures are scary for parents.  Follow the plan above, recognize the signs and symptoms, and stay calm! Posted in Seizures with fever | Leave a reply Seizures And Fevers: No Brain Frying Here! Posted on February 5, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Devan Szczepanski, a family practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. Mrs. Breaux gets a phone call at work from Sue’s daycare.  Sue needs to be picked up because she has a fever.  When Mrs. Breaux arrives, the teacher explains that 15 minutes earlier Sue fell to the floor and began shaking all over.  The shaking lasted about one minute, then Sue relaxed and slept for about 10 minutes.  Now she is waking up and when Sue sees her mom she runs over with bright red cheeks and gives mom a hug.  The teacher is concerned and insists Mrs. Breaux bring Sue to the Emergency Room. However, Sue’s mom has seen this before and knows there is no need for panic. Marco, Sue’s older brother, also had febrile seizures. Febrile seizures are much more common than people think!  Up to 4% of children will experience the “hot shakes” before 5 years old.  They sure make parents scared. Many parents are worried enough about fevers alone.  Imagine adding some seizure activity to the mix!  But the good news is that febrile seizures are perfectly safe and do not need a 9-1-1 call if the parent understands what to watch for. By “febrile seizure” we mean, simply, a seizure that goes along with a fever.  The child will have a temperature of 100.4 or greater, pass out, have rhythmic jerking of arms, face, or legs for a few minutes, and then be confused and sleepy afterward.  The sleepy period, which we call the “post-ictal state,” lasts about 10 to 20 minutes and is followed by full awakening.  Often the seizure happens first and then later the fever is noticed.  Febrile seizures follow the rule of “ S “: occur between S ix months to S ix years of age, are S hort in duration, occur S oon after illness begins, and are more common among S iblings. There is a lot of good news about febrile seizures.  Seizures don’t hurt babies’ brains. Kiddos grow out of them.  Only very few go on to have epilepsy (life-long seizures). Higher fevers do not increase a child’s chance of having a seizure.  Just because a child has a temperature of 104 doesn’t mean he is going to seize.  Some seize at 100.5, some 105, and the vast majority of kids with fevers of any height don’t have seizures.  Most kids who have a febrile seizure never have another. So what to do if my child has a seizure?  The safest thing is to “hurry up and wait!” Meaning, don’t try to stop the jerking by restraining the child, don’t start CPR, don’t force things into the mouth.  Your only job is to make sure the child can’t hurt themselves by bumping into furniture or slipping under water in the tub (another reason to never leave your child alone in a tub!).  Please keep track of the length of time the seizure lasts.  This is important because the decision for further tests or treatment is often based on how long the seizure lasted. When to worry?  If the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, call an ambulance. Paramedics carry medicine that can stop a seizure that lasts too long.  If the child does not wake up soon enough after a seizure (again, about 10 to 20 minutes), this may mean the child is more sick than from a regular virus. Get her seen. So if the fever is not frying my baby’s brain, then why is she having a seizure?  GREAT QUESTION!  All the “wise ones” of science have tried time and again to answer this question.  Ultimately, it appears that it is mostly genetic.  Your child has inherited a brain that is wired to occasionally seize when she has a fever.  And then she outgrows that. While it is important that your child see a doctor soon after the episode to be sure everything is okay, the main thing to remember is that while febrile seizures can be scary to watch, the seizure does not cause lasting harm.  In the words of Dr. Hamilton, the fever will not “fry your baby’s brain.”  Only YOUR nerves!

This winter we’ve seen nearby outbreaks of Mumps in Arkansas and Texas.  Last week a mother brought her 3 year-old daughter into the Emergency Department worried about just that.  The girl had fever and headache and mom had just heard the news.  Instead the girl turned out to have influenza virus, which causes many of the same symptoms.  But this raised the question: what exactly is the Mumps? Though it sounds like a muppet character, the mumps is an illness caused by a highly contagious virus.  The classic sign of mumps is swollen parotid glands, which are glands at the back of your cheeks.  When they swell you look like a chipmunk. Mumps usually starts with fever, headache, and maybe vomiting.  Symptoms also include cough, runny nose, poor appetite, muscle aches, and generally feeling run down.  Sure sounds like the flu- no wonder that mom was worried! The biggest concern about mumps is that in rare cases it can cause encephalitis, or brain infection and swelling.  In teenagers and adults, it can also cause exquisitely painful swelling of testicles or ovaries.  Before the mumps vaccine was invented in 1967, people were understandably scared of this disease. Now with the MMR (Measles/Mumps/Rubella) vaccine, mumps has mostly passed into history books, except for the occasional case. If there is a nearby outbreak, what do you do?  First, speak to your doctor.  If your child has concerning symptoms, she can order the mumps blood test.  A big clue to whether your child has the mumps is exposure- was your child around someone with mumps? Figuring this out can be tricky, because it can be weeks after exposure before you begin to have symptoms.  Who remembers where they were two weeks ago- it’s tough enough remembering what you had for lunch yesterday!  So usually when it comes to the individual kid, we count on the classic chipmunk-cheeks to make the diagnosis. How do you get the mumps anyway? Transmission is by respiratory droplets, which means an infected kid coughs and sneezes, or wipes his slimy hands, on his playmates.  The new victims stick those virus-laden droplets on their fingers, into their noses and mouths. So to prevent mumps, kids should do the things to prevent catching other infectious diseases, like colds and stomach viruses: they should wash their hands.  Frequent hand-washing should be taught and encouraged at home and school.  Hand sanitizer dispensers are readily available in public places, and are a reasonable substitute.  I teach kids to wash hands to the Happy Birthday song- if you wash all surfaces of your hands using the amount of time it takes to sing the song, you’ve done a great job of disinfecting. Also use disinfectant wipes to clean household and school surfaces.  Those respiratory droplets and their viruses can linger on tables and doorknobs, and contaminate unsuspecting hands that touch them later.  Teach your kids to cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbows- this keeps grubby hands from infecting surfaces too. If your child gets the mumps, the only treatment is for symptoms- there’s no medicine to make it go away quicker.  Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen for pain and fever.  The chipmunk cheeks or swollen testicles of mumps can really hurt, so don’t skimp on those medicines!  Ice packs can also soothe these sensitive parts.  Most kids and adults get over mumps in about 2 weeks.  Occasionally children need hospitalization for pain control or IV fluids.  If they get encephalitis, they’ll need intensive care to control brain swelling. Vaccination is great protection against mumps.  Kids get their first MMR shot at 12 months-old, and the second before kindergarten.  This vaccine is very safe, much safer than the car ride to the doctor’s to get it!  Some get a mild fever a week after vaccination, but serious complications are quite rare.  Like any vaccine, your child is incredibly more likely to catch and be harmed by mumps, than be harmed by the vaccine. So all concerned moms and dads out there, if your child has flu-like symptoms (cough, fever, headache, fatigue) with swollen cheeks, it might be the mumps!  See your doctor for testing.  But with vaccination, odds are you won’t ever be in this worrisome place. Posted in Measles , Mumps , Vaccines | Leave a reply When Pediatrics Got Boring Posted on September 8, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply It was 1990, my second year of residency.  I was in Emergency seeing a boy with swollen left eyelids.  I explained to his mom that he could have an infection that sometimes spreads into the eye socket, and the boy “might need a CT scan to see behind the eye.” As I was talking, I pried open the boy’s eyelids to examine the eye itself and had one of those “Whoa!” moments: the eyelids themselves weren’t swollen, they were puffed out because the boy’s eyeball was sticking out of the eye socket; pushed out by infection. “He definitely needs a CT,” I corrected, not skipping a beat, “and possibly surgery to clean out the infection.” This condition is called orbital cellulitis, and was quite common due to the bacteria Hemophilus Influenza (a.k.a. “H. Flu,” and no relation to the viral Influenza we get “flu shots” for).  But that year of my residency, the vaccine against H. Flu came out.  Vaccines had already existed against some viruses and a few bacteria like tetanus, but H. Flu was different, and required a pharmaceutical breakthrough.  That same breakthrough enabled invention of vaccines against Pneumococcus and Meningococcus, two other bad bacteria that caused lots of meningitis, blood infections, and pneumonia. In the 26 years since, pediatrics has gotten, well, kinda boring.  Wards that used to be filled with sick and dying children infected by these bacteria, emptied out. You could almost hear the crickets chirping.  Which is great for kids.  However, the success of these vaccines and their predecessors- measles, diphtheria, pertussis, etc- has led to complacence about their need. Everyone used to know of a child who died or had brain damage from one of these diseases.  But now, “out of sight, out of mind.” A recent poll of parents who don’t get their child vaccinated has revealed this false sense of security.  Many parents are afraid that vaccines are dangerous, but now even more think that they are just plain unnecessary.  But the scientific fact is that vaccines are safe, safer than riding in cars.  They may seem unnecessary just like seat belts might seem unnecessary when you’re just driving around-  right up until you get in a crash. When kids get lacerations and need stitches, we always check if they are up-to-date on tetanus.  If they’re not vaccinated, we ask the parents to allow a tetanus shot. Tetanus infects deep wounds, and is deadly.  If parents are reluctant, I tell them about my experience in the Philippines. In medical school I spent a month there, where for many, vaccines are an unaffordable luxury.  During that time I saw two kids die of tetanus- one teenager who stepped on a needle, one newborn who had her umbilical cord painted with some concoction by a village healer.  Tetanus is also called Lockjaw because it causes muscles to freeze up, including the jaw and chest muscles used for breathing.  When those lock up, the child slowly dies of asphyxiation. Despite pediatricians’ recommendations, some parents won’t get their kids vaccinated. Some think they’re unnecessary, like we discussed above. They’ve been lulled into complacency, since they don’t know anyone whose died of the diseases we vaccinate against (see how that worked?). Some worry that vaccines are dangerous.  They hear vaccines cause autism, or contain poisons.  There are even internet sites which claim vaccination is a money-making conspiracy between drug companies and doctors.  I’ve had moms whisper to me, “What’s really the truth about vaccines?” like it’s a big secret. The truth is vaccines are simply a modern technology, like cars and cell phones, and everyone seems comfortable with those.  Vaccines have been extensively studied and tested for safety.  In fact, vaccines are safer than riding in cars, and we certainly know more about vaccine safety than we do about cell phones! It’s frustrating for pediatricians trying to convince these parents otherwise. There’s a psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance, wherein if someone has a set belief, no amount of facts will sway that belief.  This phenomenon explains why people support political candidates despite data, or the candidate’s own past words, that highlight that candidate’s insincerity.  If you’re pulling your hair out because your political opposites just won’t see reason, that’s how pediatricians feel when discussing vaccines. So give your pediatrician a break- get your kids vaccinated.  Oh, and you also might save their lives. Posted in Vaccines | Leave a reply Vaccinations: The Good Old Days Weren’t So Good Posted on December 27, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply In the late 1940s and early1950s, families had two big worries.  One was of a third world war with the horrible new weapon, the atomic bomb.  The second was that children would get polio.  Polio was on the rise.  Every summer a new epidemic claimed more victims than the last.  Polio crippled kids.  Imagine worrying that your child would end up in a wheel chair, or with permanent need for crutches and leg braces.  Too many times, polio killed. Then in 1955, a research team headed by a Dr. Jonas Salk perfected a polio vaccine.  A huge immunization effort mobilized.  Dr. Salk was hailed as a national hero; everyone saw his picture and knew his name.  In a few years, polio and the mass fear it caused were all but gone. Before 1990, vaccines were universally seen as a good thing.  They prevented diseases that had cursed mankind for centuries.  Everyone wanted their kids vaccinated against these ancient killers: tetanus, measles, pertussis, diphtheria, smallpox, polio.  They weren’t often nice deaths either: tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria kill by suffocating the child. Then in 1990, researchers had the last big breakthrough in vaccines- vaccinating against killer bacteria.  The last of the really bad actors, Haemophilus Influenzae, Pneumococcus, and Meningococcus, began to disappear.  Ancient fears disappeared.  Generations since have forgotten how in 1900, one out of every ten babies died before they got to their first birthday. People since have begun to ask: why are we putting these chemicals into our children’s bodies?  Why are they enduring these painful shots?  No one seems to be dying around us.  Now people are starting to refuse to get their children vaccinated.  1990 is also when the Internet began to rise.  The Internet is great for spreading information, but it is also great for spreading ignorance.  Search for vaccinations on the net, and you will get lots of sites on how immunizations are somehow poisonous to your child. My message is simple: don’t get complacent about the good vaccines do.  No one seems to be dying of these contagious diseases because of vaccines. Vaccines are safe.  Vaccines work even when they are all taken at once.  If you want more information on vaccines, go to the experts: the American Academy of Pediatrics. And get your children their shots. Posted in Vaccines | Leave a reply Why Does My Child Need All Those Shots? Posted on October 10, 2011 by klfydoctor 1 The room was suffused with pale light.  There was no noise, no breeze.  Two children lay on hospital beds, sedated.  The only sign of distress would come every few minutes when one of them would tense his whole body, breathing hitching, face clenched.  Both children were almost certain to die.  They had tetanus. It was 1989, and I was rounding with pediatric residents in a hospital in the Philippines.  I was there for a month-long elective during medical school, and spent my mornings learning about diseases we rarely see in the United States.  We rounded on our two tetanus patients every morning, doing what little we could, and waiting.  Finally one morning when we came by, the room was empty. In the Philippines, vaccinations are a luxury that many cannot afford.  One of the children was a teenage boy who stepped on a pin.  A tiny injury, but the pinhead must have held a few spores of the Claustridium Tetani bacteria.  Driven deep into his foot, where there was little of the oxygen that prevents tetanus from growing, the infection flourished.  The other child was a newborn who had had his umbilical cord painted with a dirty concoction by the village healer. When someone gets infected with tetanus, the bacteria puts out a poison that causes all the body’s muscles to freeze up.  Some of the strongest and most obvious muscles are those one chews with- hence the slang “Lock jaw.”  In the Philippines, where they have few Intensive Care Units, the best the doctors can do is give the patients Valium in an attempt to help the muscles relax.  The room was so quiet and calm because any noise, any breeze, any stimulation triggers the muscle spasms. However, such treatment is a fool’s errand.  The muscles spasm anyway, most concerning the muscles of the ribcage.  When they spasm, the patient can’t breathe.  Tetanus is a slow death of oxygen starvation.  Even with more high-tech intensive medicine in the US, tetanus still kills up to a third of its victims. In the days before vaccines such infections terrified people.  Diseases like tetanus and diphtheria killed individually.  Other epidemic infections, like polio and influenza, killed in waves.  In 1919, 1 to 3% of the world’s population died of Spanish Influenza; one out of every four persons on the planet was sick with fever and cough.  In some places, there were not enough well people to bury the dead.  In 1952 the polio epidemic had every parent in the United States worried that their child would end up a leg-braced cripple, or dead. But these days, such terrors of the past have been forgotten (except in movies like Contagion, which was all the more scary because it was so scientifically accurate).  Vaccinations that prevent such diseases have made us feel safe from deadly infection.  And now, in such an atmosphere of comfort, people forget why we vaccinate.  Some even question the safety and use of vaccination.  Myths about vaccination dangers have become mainstream “knowledge.” Here are some more commonplace vaccine myths- all NOT true:  If you take too many vaccines at once, they don’t all “take.”  Fortunately, this is not how the immune system works- it does not have limited “energy” to take on new tasks.  Another myth is that you can’t take a vaccination when you are sick with a cold or on an antibiotic.  Again, the vaccine will “take” and not make you any sicker, except a few vaccines that might give you a small fever. The bigger myths are more scary: vaccines cause brain injury, vaccines poison.  These side effects, if true , are very rare.  Concerned doctors and scientists have been trying for decades to find a connection between these alleged bad side effects and the vaccines, and have been unsuccessful.  Thus this wisdom still holds true: your chance of being harmed by a disease is gigantic compared to your chances of being harmed by the disease’s vaccine.  In other words, getting the vaccines is safe; getting the diseases is not. So make sure your kids get their shots on time.  Get your shots too- tetanus and flu.  That is the best way to avoid …..CONTAGION !

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Depression A Tale of Two Teenagers Posted on January 27, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply Hard to believe, Amy loves the Army.  She’s in boot camp, enjoying lots of exercise, full days, new jargon to learn, and she even likes the lectures on Army protocol. It’s stressful to be sure; it’s supposed to be tough.  Some girls are fainting, some are washing out because they can’t hack it, some stay up too late and lose sleep. Amy has her eyes on the prize- graduating and moving up.  When she gets anxious, she swallows it and moves on. Uncharacteristic for her, she’s eating well and going to bed early.  Her parents are proud, not only for her accomplishment but for how far Amy has come.  Her life wasn’t always this way. From an early age, Amy was having a rough go.  She had trouble paying attention in first grade, though she was highly intelligent.  She angered some teachers with her pointed, seemingly rude commentaries, though other teachers “got” her. She was tried on ADHD medications, which helped for a time, but then began causing side effects where Amy acted confused and panicky.  By high school, it was clear Amy was depressed.  She was sullen, didn’t get along with most of her classmates, and scraped out poor grades. Despite grasping the material, she just didn’t care enough to get papers in on time or study for tests. Amy had no obvious reason for depression.  She had two loving, educated parents and two happy siblings.  At the first sign of trouble with attention or mood, she got the best doctors and therapists.  As Amy got older and was able to verbalize what was going on inside, it seemed her depression was “chemical:”  she was just born that way, with no external reasons like bullying or her looks. Anti-depressant medication helped, as did continued counseling.  Her parents cheered her on through thick and thin, and as she got older Amy’s life began looking up.  College was much better than high school as far as academics and having friends. She had positive dreams for her future.  Joining the Army wasn’t her parents first choice; heck, even with a bachelor’s degree she enlisted rather than take on the responsibility of being an officer. But now they were singing a different tune. Sharon has it much worse than Amy.  I saw Sharon in the Emergency Department last month.  She came by ambulance after being beaten by a gang of boys.  They ran up behind her, knocked her down, and kicked her repeatedly in the head and chest. There had apparently been some bad blood between Sharon’s friends and other factions in the neighborhood. From our computer record I saw that Sharon had had a tough life already, though only 15 years-old. She had been seen by us twice for sexual assaults, another time for being beaten up, and once to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal thoughts. She came from a rough house in a rough neighborhood.  Her mom obviously had mental illness of her own, from the pressured speech of hyperactivity or drug use, to her peculiar tattoos.  Mom yelled a lot, at Sharon and us, though this seemed to be not from anger but how she usually spoke. Certainly Sharon’s depression has not gotten the attention that Amy’s did.  Though she had been in hospital for depression, Sharon isn’t on anti-depressants and isn’t in counseling.  Chaos rules her home life: her father’s gone, and she bounces between mom’s and the homes of several other families. Her school and neighborhood aren’t safe. Despite all this, I have some hope for Sharon.  Kids can be resilient, and Sharon still had an occasional smile and some spunk, despite what just happened.  Mom also did seem to care about her, as did an aunt with her who seemed more emotionally stable.  They agreed that counseling was a good idea, and to see her doctor about a psychiatric referral. Some kids like Amy are born with depression.  Some like Sharon, besides having inborn depression, also have life stresses that contribute.  Both kids need attention- counseling and maybe medicine to get them through bad patches. If your kid seems depressed, telling them to buck up and act happier isn’t enough.  You should ask about suicidal thoughts, why he is depressed, and see his doctor.  Depression is rough, so better that your kid gets the attention that Amy got, rather than Sharon’s. Posted in Depression , Talking with Teenagers , Teen Health Care | Leave a reply Your Kid May Not Be Lazy.  Your Kid May Be Depressed! Posted on September 6, 2012 by klfydoctor 2 We see a lot of depressed children and teenagers in the Emergency Department.  Often it is because the child is suicidal.  Either he or she has has attempted to kill himself, or has stated that he wants to.  Depression often comes to us under other guises too- headaches, stomach aches, fatigue, anxiety, chest pain and palpitations.  A suicidal child or teen is a terribly painful thing for parents as well as the patient.  How do things get this far? Sometimes the child is stressed and feeling bad because of things going on outside the home, and outside themselves.  Kids can have trouble with friends, girlfriends or boyfriends, bullies, or teachers.  These things can get a kid depressed, but it often takes other stresses as well to get them so bad that they are suicidal.  More difficult for the kid are the troubles in the home, or the troubles in him or her self. Change in the home can make a kid sad, such as divorce, moving, parents losing jobs, new parental boy or girlfriends moving in.  Some parents are abusive to their spouse or kid, yelling and hitting.  Sometimes the parents just don’t know how to handle their kid well.   When the kid seems lazy or stubborn, they punish the kid.  If the kid does not act better, they punish her some more.  Then they punish more, even when punishment has clearly not worked to change that particular kid’s behavior.  Meanwhile, all that punishment certainly is not helping the child feel better about themselves. Finally, depression often happens because of something within the child.  They have ADHD, or bipolar disorder, or mood disorders.  Teenagers have hormones raging in them, and a skewed perspective on life.  Little problems to us are often huge in the life of a teenager.  When a kid gets suicidal, it is often because of a brew of factors outside the home, inside the home, and inside the kid. How do parents prevent kids from getting so down they are suicidal?  It is not easy, because kids will hide their problems, especially if they and their parents are not getting along.  Sometimes, the clues are subtle- slipping school work, multiple vague complaints (headaches, stomachaches, etc), poor appetite.  Sometimes the clues don’t help us be sympathetic with our child, like when they fight with us, get defiant, or just shut down and do not talk at all. If it seems your child or teen is getting depressed, act now.  First, start being open and friendly, instead of a drill sergeant.  Forgive your kid’s bad behavior, so you can begin to find out the whys.  Ask them straight out- are you depressed?  Are you suicidal?  Do you have a plan about how you would kill yourself?  It the answer is yes, time to seek help. The best helpers to start with are either school counselors, or church counselors. Just about all schools and most religious denominations have staff trained to talk with kids about their troubles.  They can help parents decide if the child is going to be okay, or needs more intense and professional counseling and maybe medication. So watch for depression if your kid is troublesome, or glum, or acting in those ways above.   Do not be embarrassed to get help if you are not sure, or if things are looking bad.  Getting help sooner is much better than seeing me later.

Posted on June 17, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply My college required students to take four blocks of Physical Education, much like high school, except we chose the sports.  We also had to pass a swim test to graduate.  My roommate Brian, who’d never learned to swim, had to use his PE blocks to take swim lessons until he passed that test.  So while the rest of my buddies and me were horsing around in floor hockey or golf lessons, Brian was off to the campus pool in swim trunks, towel around his neck, trailed by jokes about playing in the “kiddie pool,” and “don’t forget your water wings.” Learning to swim and playing in the pool are great ways to spend the hot summer. It’s good exercise and though kids are outdoors, they stay cool.  And they have fun!  More importantly for we in Emergency services, knowing how to swim is good drowning prevention. Proper swim lessons, like in the Boy Scouts, don’t only teach swimming.  They also teach water safety, because even good swimmers can get into trouble, like my buddy Walt. Walt is an ER doctor who had been in the Air Force Pararescue, or “PJs.” This elite team’s mission is to rescue downed pilots, particularly in water. Needless to say, Walt was as capable in water as any Navy Seal.  One day at the beach, however, he and his 8 year-old son got caught in a riptide and were taken out to sea. Hundreds of yards off shore, Walt saw a current that would sweep them back, but the stream he was in prevented him from swimming there.  After hours of trying to break through while holding up his son, growing exhausted, he resigned himself to throwing his son to the beach-bound current before he himself drowned.  Just then a rogue wave slapped them into that good current and they got home. After that, Walt never went to the beach without numerous flotation devices and a long rope.  Good swim lessons likewise teach about safety and rescue strategies like having flotation and other equipment handy.  They also teach the buddy system so everyone is accounted for in a crowd. Playing outdoors in the summer is great exercise too, though not as cooling as swimming.  Kids can get overheated, especially if they are in sports practices.  Several times in July and August we get football players in the Emergency Department with heat exhaustion.  The boys start to get muscle cramps, and then can become sleepy and sometimes confused.  When they are confused or difficult to arouse, we worry about heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency. Dr. James Andrews, a famed sports orthopedic surgeon, wrote a book called “Any Given Monday: Sports Injuries and How to Prevent Them.”  In that book he advocates kids cutting back on organized sports when they are young, to avoid repetitive injuries that he used to see only in college and professional athletes.  This allows for more unstructured outdoor play for kids that’s easier on their joints.  Kid-driven play also helps avoid heat injury. In regular play, there’s no training agenda to drive kids past their comfort zone.  Kids can goof around outside all they want, and when they get hot and thirsty come in to get drinks and cool off.  They take breaks whenever they want.  In coach-driven sports, kids are pushed to the limits of their endurance to improve performance.  Sometimes they are pushed too far, and get over-heated. However, organized sports practice can be made safer. Coaches should allow unlimited water breaks.  Heat injury happens with temperature and dehydration working together to punish; plenty of fluids prevents that.  Breaks should be in the shade.  Teams should practice in cooler times of day, early morning and late afternoon or evening.  Football practice should start with shorts and tee-shirts, with endurance and equipment gradually added in following weeks.  Finally, coaches should watch players for signs of heat exhaustion, just like they watch for signs of concussion.  If players acts groggy, they should be rested and hydrated in the shade. So let your kids play freely outdoors. They should get swimming lessons and have lots of pool time to play and exercise.  If they are outdoors in the yard, be sure they take plenty of water and cooling-off breaks, and have sprinklers to play in.  Come to think of it, maybe football practices should have lots of running through the sprinklers too!

Posted on April 10, 2015 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Dr. Kevin Morris and Dr. Richard Pearson, Family Practice residents at the University Health Center here in Lafayette.  Dr. Morris is a former paramedic, and knows of what he speaks: It’s warming up and sunny, let’s go swimming!  ” Rescue 51, respond to the swimming pool in the Sunset neighborhood, 3 year-old drowning.” This request no paramedic likes to hear.  Upon arrival, the girl is found lying next to the pool, having been pulled out by her parents.  She is unresponsive and has no pulse.  We work frantically to save her.  The family tells us they were having a reunion, with twelve children and thirty adults.  No one saw her go into the pool.  This potentially tragic event is avoidable, with simple steps. As temperatures rise, we begin to think about staying cool and having fun.  Both needs are met by jumping in the pool and we’re all for it!  It’s great exercise and play, and gets the kids outside.  And they certainly can’t bring a phone or video game in with them!  However, we all need to be aware of the danger. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), every day two children in the US die from drowning, and another ten go to the Emergency Department for non-fatal submersion.  Drowning is the second leading cause of death in ages 1 to 14 years, only behind car crashes.  There are many, easy ways to dramatically improve safety. One of the most common reasons drownings occur is a lapse in supervision.  We all enjoy the poolside- barbequing, drinking, visiting, swimming, and making big splashes. All this distracts from the young non-swimmers.  When children are there, it’s important for one supervising adult to be distraction-free to watch the kids. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends “touch supervision,” meaning that children are always within touching distance at the pool. When it’s a party at the pool with adults and kids milling around, it’s impossible for any adult to stay 100% vigilant.  That’s how tragedies like our child above happen, even with a designated watcher.  Therefore life jackets are great for non-swimmers in the group. They are easy to use and really help.  Air-filled toys and “floaties” are adorable and fun, but just aren’t safe enough. The girl from above had been at a pool that was fenced, but went through the gate unnoticed.  It’s not unusual to accidentally leave a gate open, so a self-closing and self-latching gate may save a life.  Sometimes children impress us with their craftiness and do things we never thought possible, like opening “child-proof” locks. Thus the gate latch should be at the top of the fence where small children can’t reach.  Also, pool fences should be on all four sides of the pool: having the pool open to a patio door invites disaster.  To see what your pool fence and gate should look like, check out hotel pools- many have great fence systems. One of the best ways to protect children from drowning is teaching them to swim. Kids who have formal swimming lessons are safer from drowning.  Lessons are recommended for age 5 and up, but can be started earlier depending on the child’s maturity. The Boy Scouts have one of the best swimming programs, because it drills kids in pool and water safety as it teaches the actual swimming. A word about another big group at risk for drowning: teenagers.  Teens, like toddlers, are natural risk takers.  They don’t think ahead, and spend time with their friends at bayous and lakes.  They may be drinking, jumping into unknown bodies of water, boating, and yet not know how to swim.  No teen should be at a pool, lake, bayou, or any body of water without being able to swim.  Talk to your teens about safety- not drinking, wearing life jackets, and not diving into shallow water, or water where you can’t see the bottom. Here in Louisiana everyone has a tragic story about water and a careless teen. With these simple steps, playing in the water can be much safer for the kids and less stressful for parents.  Get out, stay active, enjoy the weather, and laissez les bon temps rouler! Posted in Drowning Prevention | Leave a reply Water Safety In The Wettest State In The Union Posted on May 2, 2013 by klfydoctor Reply One day the ambulance brought in a 13 year-old who had almost drowned in a local hotel pool.  He was awake on arrival, but everyone had a good scare.  The pool had a deep end but no lifeguard. The boy could not swim, the parents told us, but enjoyed bobbing in the shallow end, going to the bottom and then pushing up out of the water.  This time he had bobbed and bobbed is way into the deep end until he couldn’t bob up high enough to reach the surface.  The boy remembers looking up and seeing his parents helplessly looking back down at him.  They could not swim either. All the parents could do was shout from above: “Get out of the pool!”  I guess they could not make the connection that “can’t swim” means “can’t get himself out of the pool.”  Eventually a more capable adult jumped in and hauled the boy out. This story illustrates several points for swimming safety.  Water is fun and inviting.  If you don’t know how to swim, however, water is deadly when you get in (literally) over your head.  Being safe means knowing how to swim.  Summer is coming and it is time to sign your kids up for lessons.  The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts have excellent swimming programs.  One of the first things a Boy Scout learns is not just how to swim, but how to swim safely.  The lessons l learned at Scout Summer Camp stick with me today. The first safety principal is swim at a pool with a lifeguard.  Lifeguards have training to save drowning kids without endangering others.  There are too many stories in the news about people who jump in to save a foundering child, and end up drowning too.  It takes training and equipment to safely rescue a swimmer in trouble. Next, swim with a buddy.  That way if one gets in trouble, the other one is there to help.  It is also just good sense to have someone account for you.  Lastly, have flotation devices at the pool.  If someone gets in trouble, throwing them a float to hang on to is better than offering your hand.  You don’t want to get pulled into the water and taken to the bottom by a panicking victim. There are two groups of kids that tend to drown more: toddlers in water at home, and teenagers in open water like lakes and rivers.  The best way to prevent a toddler from drowning is not to have a pool or pond on your property.  Everyone loses track of their little one sometime.  It is impossible to prevent.  They are natural explorers, and poor listeners (they barely speak English yet!).  They are going to get out and into things- the street, the cleaning products, the backyard pool.  If you don’t have a body of water at home to fall into, you eliminate the risk of them falling in and not being able to get back out- a pond doesn’t even have to be over the child’s head to be deadly! If you already have a pool or pond, the next best thing is to fence it on all four sides.  No back door access to the pool!  The fence should be toddler proof.  This means a fence that can’t be climbed, with a lock too high for the toddler to reach.  If you haven’t seen that kind of fence before, visit a local hotel pool.  They will have one. Talking to your toddler only helps a little, but talking to your teenager works (somewhat) better.  Despite what we all say about teens, they do listen, particularly when we talk directly to them about safety.  It helps to talk to them earlier- at ages 10-12, about not drinking while swimming or boating, about not diving into shallow water, about swimming with buddies who are also safe and responsible.  Talk to them nicely!  Tell them you trust them to do the right thing, but as a parent you have to remind them to be safe.  Take the eye rolling and “you’ve told me this a thousand times” in stride.  Teens do this even when they are listening. Drowning is preventable- do your part.  Secure any water at home, get the kids swimming lessons, and talk to those teens.  Let them get wet this summer, but safely! Posted in Drowning Prevention | Leave a reply Its Summer- Get Wet!  Safely! Posted on July 9, 2012 by klfydoctor Reply My wife grew up here in Lafayette, and has more than one story about teenage friends and acquaintances dying in boating accidents.  With teenagers, of course there was alcohol involved.  As a Pediatric Emergency Medicine doctor, I have seen more than my fair share of toddlers who drowned.  The stories are all the same- there was a pool or pond or coolie or river in the yard, the parents lost track of the child for just a few minutes, and tragedy happened. Drowning is the second leading cause of accidental child death, after car crashes.  With kids, “accidental” is another way of saying “preventable.”  As I hinted at above, there are two main groups of kids that drown: toddlers in bodies of water near the home, and teens in open water like lakes and rivers.  We in Louisiana need to be extra careful because in case you haven’t heard, we have lots of water around here. The best way to prevent toddler drowning is not to have a pool or pond on your property.  Everyone loses track of their toddler sometime.  It is just about impossible to prevent that.  They are natural explorers, and poor listeners (they barely speak english yet!).  They are going to get out and get into things- the street, the cleaning products  under the sink, the backyard pool.  If you don’t have a body of water to fall into, you eliminate that risk.  If you already have one, the next best thing is to fence it in on all four sides.  No back door patio access to the pool!  Have a toddler-proof fence.  That means a fence that can’t be climbed, with a lock too high for the toddler to reach.  If you haven’t seen that kind of fence before, visit a local hotel.  They will have one. It isn’t helpful to just talk to your toddler about staying away from water.  They aren’t good listeners.  However, you can talk to your teenager.  Despite what we all say about teens they do listen, particularly when we talk directly to them about their safety.  But you have to talk to them early- age 10-12, about not drinking and boating,  about not diving in shallow water, about swimming with buddies who are also safe and responsible.  Talk to them nicely!- tell them you trust them to do the right thing, but as a parent you can’t help yourself to remind them to be safe.  Take the eye-rolling and the “you’ve told me this a thousand times” in stride.  Teens do this even when they are listening.

Posted on July 20, 2009 by klfydoctor Reply This morning Tracy Wirtz and I talked about drowning prevention.  Whenever I talk about drowning the worst cases I have seen come to mind, but also the silliest.  One day I was in the Emergency Room when the ambulance brought in a 13 year-old who came close to drowning in a local hotel pool.  He was awake and alert on arrival, but everyone was understandably shaken.  The hotel pool had a deep end but no life guard. The 13 year-old could not swim, the parents told us,  but enjoyed bobbing in the shallow end, going to the bottom and then pushing up out of the water.  Well, he bobbed and bobbed his way unwittingly to the deep end until he could no longer bob up high enough to reach the surface.   The boy described to us looking up at the surface, seeing his parents helplessly looking back down on him.  They could not swim either. If it is not apparent by now that this was not a group of deep thinkers, here came the kicker: to try to rescue their boy, the parents told me that they shouted down to him “Get out of the pool!”  They could not make the connection that “not being able to swim” means “he can’t get himself out of the pool.”  Eventually a more capable adult jumped in and hauled the boy out. This story illustrates several drowning prevention points.  Water is inviting and fun.  If you do not know how to be safe, though, water is deadly when you get (literally) in over your head. Being safe means knowing how to swim, swimming where there are lifeguards, and knowing what to do if there are kids by the water who do not know how to swim. No toddler should be left alone by any water, including tubs and wading pools and shallow ponds.  Like our goofy parents above, toddlers can not tell what is safe and what isn’t.  Then it is easy for them to stumble, hit their head on hard tub sides or rocks, and go face down and unconscious into the water.  All home pools should be fenced on all four sides with unclimbable fences and toddler-proof latches (too high for them to reach).  Having the pool open to the back sliding door is an invitation for disaster. Toddlers thus need to be watched all the time near water.  It is impossible to watch a toddler always and everywhere, but near water you can not slip.  My last drowning death was a two-year old whose parents lost track of him at home and he was found face down in the backyard pond.  Near deeper water, toddlers should wear life jackets. Older kids should have swimming lessons, always swim with a buddy, and swim in guarded pools or with alert, capable adults.  Throwable rescue floats , like life rings with rope, should be handy.  Ideally, adults should know CPR.  Drowning victims are only saved when their breathing is restored at water-side.  Bystander CPR is the key to survival- brains die of lack of oxygen before most ambulances have a chance to get to the scene.  The only time in my experience that an ambulance crew revived a drowned toddler was when the firehouse was across the street from the scene. Besides toddlers, the other group at high-risk for drowning is teenagers.  Their tragedies often begin with drinking, and then swimming, boating, or diving in unguarded lakes or rivers.  Since teenagers are such bad listeners, the time to warn them about this is when they are still young elementary school kids.  That is the time of life when kids absorb the lessons they need for later. If any of you readers have any other tips or exciting stories of drowning survival, feel free to comment!

The parents were overjoyed.  First, Natalie impressed them with her thoroughness: “You were the first to feel her neck glands.”  Second, they felt like we really listened to their story.  Finally, they had a diagnosis, knowing what was wrong and what to expect for the future.  Unfortunately it was more of the same- fever and throat pain. Mononucleosis is a viral infection that causes fever, fatigue, sore throat, and swollen glands.  As a virus, antibiotics can’t kill it- it must run its course, and mono can last weeks. We could only offer a course of steroids.  Sometimes steroids decrease the throat inflammation, pain, and swelling; sometimes not. This story illustrates how people need answers for their pain and misery.  Ours was the fourth visit the family had in 8 days in their search for a diagnosis.Test after test had been run.  This craving for answers is a natural desire in patients and families and of course in doctors.  We all find comfort in diagnosis- finally to know what is wrong, and what to expect in the future. Unfortunately, parents’ and doctors’ zeal to find answers can hurt.  A natural inclination when the diagnosis is uncertain is to order more tests, to try more medicines to see if something helps.  But tests have a price.  Too many xrays and CT scans mean radiation, which can cause cancer later in life.  To kids, blood tests mean needles, dread, and pain.  And needles and catheters can cause infections, invading the body with devices that introduce germs where they can thrive. Starting medicines like antibiotics without a firm diagnosis can also cause harm. Antibiotics have side effects.  They can cause allergic reactions; vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps; and yeast infections.  Antibiotics don’t kill viruses, so giving them in cases like our girl above increases risk for more misery, with no benefit. Another consequence of needing diagnosis is a phenomenon called “The Vulnerable Child,” where the diagnosis scares the parents into thinking their child is fragile.  This often starts with a benign diagnosis like allergies. The parents are happy to be given an answer, but then believe that their kid is now sickly. They become overly protective. They don’t let him go out to play or do sports. They limit his friends.  He grows up with less fun, more isolation, and less exercise. Though the child’s body is fine, the parents don’t see it that way, even after being told that he is basically healthy.  The Vulnerable Child can start with diagnoses like asthma, prematurity, even simple heart murmurs. The best way to make diagnoses then, without unnecessary tests and drug trials, is with a thorough history.  Your doctor should get a complete story of your child’s illness, detailed from start to finish.  This takes lots of listening and lots of questions. The doctor then needs to do a thorough physical, looking for all the clues to confirm what the child’s history has suggested.  Doctors make 85% of their diagnoses by history alone; physical exams and tests usually only confirm diagnoses, not make them. And patience is needed.  It can take time to make a diagnosis; disease can be slow to reveal itself.  Consider our girl from above with the sore throat- first impressions of cold viruses or strep throat are usually right, but it took eight days of treatment failure and negative tests and progressing symptoms to have “mononucleosis” jump out at us. A lot of those tests and the antibiotics could have been avoided.  So, don’t let an addiction to diagnosis get in the way of, well, the diagnosis. Posted in Value of tests | Leave a reply Should I Order a Test, or Listen First? Posted on February 11, 2010 by klfydoctor Reply It happens at least once per week that a family brings their child in with a frustrating problem.  The complaints are vague, like mild fever off and on for weeks or months, or headaches or belly pain, or odd rashes.  The problem has usually been going on for weeks or months and no doctor has been able to give the family a solid diagnosis.  The family asks me: “There has got to be some test to figure this out!” There is a myth that the sophisticated technology of testing, whether it is blood tests, CT scanning, or MRI scanning, can diagnose all ills.  Patients and families believe it, and many doctors also fall into the habit of relying on batteries of tests to help them feel better about their diagnoses. But this is not true.  The vast majority of tests provide us only with a hint that our diagnosis is on the right path.  Some tests, particularly CTs and MRIs, give too much information.  It happens regularly that we order a CT scan, find something that looks funny, and chase a phantom with further tests.  It is not unusual for a doctor and his patient to get caught in what I call the “medical vortex,” where one test leads to another.  After thousands and thousands of dollars of painful testing, the doctor finally says “nothing serious is wrong.” When it comes to making a diagnosis, the old wisdom we all learned in medical school holds true: you make 85% of your diagnoses from taking the medical history alone.  As the father of modern medicine, William Osler, said almost a hundred years ago, “listen to the patient, he is telling you his diagnosis.”  The next 10% of diagnosis comes from the physical exam.  That leaves only 5% of cases where the test makes you go “Ah-hah, so that’s it!”  Again, tests mostly just hint. Thus if you ever have a family member with a medical problem that they just can’t figure out, make sure first that they are asking enough questions.  Make sure that the doctor is getting a clear picture of what is going on with the patient.  A thorough enough history almost always shows where others have missed a vital clue. If the doctor starts doing tests, he or she should have a firm idea of how the tests are going to help make the diagnosis, rather than a vague notion that they will shed some light somewhere.  Before the tests, the doctor should have listened carefully to your story, asked questions exhaustively, and examined you thoroughly.  If so, he or she then probably doesn’t need the tests in the first place!

Posted on March 10, 2017 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnist is Dr. Chris Fontenot, a Family Practice resident at the University Hospital and Clinics here in  Lafayette. Dreaded words at 7 pm on Friday night: “Mommy, Daddy, my throat hurts.”  Doctor’s closed, nowhere to turn.  It’s a common complaint, especially in my house with three girls. You’ve had sore throats yourself, and know-they hurt! Pharyngitis- doctor talk for throat inflammation- accounts for about 12 million office and ER visits yearly.  Pharyngitis has two main causes- viral (about 85% of cases), and bacterial (about 15%).  Many viruses cause sore throats, like adenovirus, rhinovirus, and influenza (“the flu”).  The most common bacteria is Group A Streptococcus, a.k.a. Strep Throat. It’s hard to tell the difference between strep and viral pharyngitis.  Besides throat pain, both cause headache, fever, and fatigue.  However, viruses tend to have more cough and runny nose.  But having those doesn’t exclude strep! There’s a few rules for doctors to separate the two.  First, strep throat happens mostly after age 3- red throats in babies and toddlers are rarely bacterial.  Second, if the child has a fine-bumpy, sand-papery rash on the trunk and face, that’s the “scarlet fever” of strep. The most important rule is that, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it’s tough to differentiate the two without a strep test. The test is a throat swab that indicates if strep bacteria is present. It’s a good test, but not perfect, catching about 85% of strep throats.  Thus your doctor must weigh the symptoms, the exam, AND the strep test to decide if your child has strep.  If it’s strep, he needs an antibiotic.  If it’s viral, antibiotics don’t kill viruses. This is the kicker for parents.  Sore throats hurt, and everyone wants them gone. Many want antibiotics, thinking they will help.  But they won’t stop viruses, and we don’t give unnecessary antibiotics for good reasons.  Antibiotics have side effects- yeast infections, stomach upset, and possibly allergic reactions.  Most importantly, when your body is exposed to antibiotics, bacteria can develop resistance to the antibiotics, and when you do need them to fight that bacteria, they won’t work. We’ve all had throat pain, and it’s miserable.  Dr. Hamilton tells of having yearly sore throats as a teenager.  When he got them, he remembers praying for the pain to go, counting the days of misery, and vowing to never again take feeling good for granted! Like we mentioned above, there’s no cure for viral sore throats.  The virus must run it’s course, typically 2 to 4 days.  If it’s a bacterial strep throat, which again is the minority of cases, only then will an antibiotic help.  So how to treat those viral illnesses that your child must “ride out?” Dr. Hamilton doesn’t remember taking medicine for his sore throats, besides throat sprays and lozenges.  And often when we see kids in the Emergency Department, parents haven’t given anything for pain either.  For your child’s sake, please do! There’s two medicines for pain and fever, perfectly safe for kids: Acetaminophen (brand name Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).  These come in many forms and flavors to make them easier for kids to take- liquids, chewable tabs; and for toddlers who spit out medicine instead of swallowing, acetaminophen rectal suppositories. No prescription necessary. Many parents, afraid to overdose their kids, don’t give enough medicine for the pain or fever.  Again, it’s quite safe to give what’s advised on the box for your child’s age or weight.  Still unsure?  Call your doctor’s office to double-check dosing. Give lots of fluids to help your kid feel better.  She may not eat much, and that’s okay. Fluids are more important, and she’s not going to starve in a few days.  If she does want food, light meals are best, like grits, oatmeal, or soup.  Popsicles and ice cream can soothe throats too. Keep your child out of school or daycare- don’t let them spread the illness to others. They won’t feel like learning anyway.  If your child has strep, they must stay out of school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotics, since it’s highly contagious. If your kid keeps getting strep after strep infection, your doctor can refer him to an ENT surgeon for tonsillectomy.  For the vast majority of sore throats though, 2 to 4 days and things will pass.  Push fluids, give pain medicine, and don’t take feeling good for granted again.

CIS Physicians at LGMC are First to Use New Technology 03/11/2013 Lafayette General Medical Center is the first hospital in the area to adopt a new technology that saves heart muscle during heart attacks. Traditional methods during cardiac catheterizations restore blood flow to the heart, but the procedure itself can cause damage to the heart muscle. Patients are typically provided with IV medication during and following the procedure to protect the patient. After the procedure, blood thinners are prescribed to dissolve clots and to prevent new clots from forming inside the stent. However, recent data suggests one in two patients do not fill necessary prescriptions, which can lead to readmission and possibly a subsequent heart attack.

Posted on August 8, 2012 by klfydoctor 1 My mom loved to tell this story about school kids on a field trip.  She ran our church’s tutoring program for inner-city kids, providing fun and enrichment where their schools could not.  She once brought the crew to a planetarium, thinking the star show would excite them about science and the universe.  When the lights came up after the show however, every single one of the kids was fast asleep.  She laughed at herself about her failure that day, but now it makes me think about sleep as a growing health problem for kids. School is starting soon, and it is time to get those kids back to sleep at a decent time.  Kids are getting less sleep than they need these days.  There are too many stimulating things to keep them up- computers, TVs with cable, i phones, video games,and too much soda.  Not getting enough sleep leads to many health problems. Kids that don’t get enough sleep are less happy, and have fewer friends.  Who can be happy when they spend their day half in the bag with fatigue?  And who can make friends when they are groggy and grumpy? There is also recent evidence that asthma and anxiety attacks are more frequent in tired kids.  Most importantly, kids need to be awake in school to learn.  Every one should know that the most certain way to life-long happiness and success is a good education. So how to get those kids to bed and asleep?  First, begin to walk those bedtimes back earlier and earlier.  If they are now getting to sleep at midnight, have lights out starting at 11pm for a few days, then 10 pm for a few more, and finally to 8 or 9 pm.  Don’t allow any screens in their bedrooms- this is how kids stay stimulated and awake without you necessarily knowing.  This means having no TVs, no computers, no video games, and no phones in their bedroom.  Finally, do not let them have soda at dinnertime or after (heck, they shouldn’t have soda anytime, except for very special occasions). Its back to school and thus back to bed time.  Your kids deserve to be awake in school, to do well, be well, and be happy.  And maybe they’ll stay awake to enjoy the planetarium too! Posted in Sleep Health | 1 Reply Back To School: Eyes Open or Shut? Posted on August 11, 2011 by klfydoctor Reply When I was a kid, I remember my parents getting a call from my older brother Pat’s teacher.  He was falling asleep in class.  Perhaps, the teacher suggested, he should get to bed sooner?  You would think, both my parents being teachers themselves, that they would have known that 11pm was too late a bedtime for a sixth grader!  But they took the advice with good humor, walked Pat’s bedtime back to 8pm, and he started to perform better in school.  In fact he grew up to go to college at MIT, so on the whole he and my parents did pretty good with the school thing. Kids getting enough sleep is a problem.  A toddler needs about 12 hours of sleep per night, a school age kid needs 10-11 hours, and a teenager needs a good 8 to 9 hours.  Do your kids get that much sleep on a school night?  Experts are saying that more and more kids are going to school as walking zombies, as their sleep is cut short by more demands from in-home media, sports, activities, homework, and waking up early for school. If kids don’t get enough sleep, they have trouble doing well in school.  No one can concentrate on lessons or hear about homework assignments when they are drousy.   These kids also have problems getting along with their classmates- who isn’t grumpy after a poor night’s sleep?  Persistent sleepiness and the effects of school and friend trouble can lead to worse symptoms of depression.  Kids that don’t get enough sleep also get sick more easily, and then they come to see me. How to fix a sleep problem?  First, of course, get them to bed earlier!  However, getting them to sleep requires some other things.  Make sure they don’t have any caffeinated drinks for dinner- no sodas or tea.  Don’t allow any scary or violent TV before bedtime (heck, no kid should be watching TV on a school night anyway!). When it is time for lights out in the bedroom- that means all lights, including those from TVs, computers, and cellphones.  These media should not be allowed in the bedroom anyway, ever!  Finally, kids should get to bed early enough so they can wake up to have time for breakfast.  Besides enough sleep, kids need a healthy breakfast, big or small, to do their best at school. So get these kids to bed on time now, before school starts.  Walk those bedtimes back an hour a night so they can learn to fall asleep sooner and not be lying in bed awake for too long.   Encourage reading before bedtime instead of TV- science shows that brains calm down better with reading.  With a little attention to sleep, maybe your kids will end up going to MIT too!

})(); Search Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Home About Downloads Category Archives: Traveling with Children When Vacation Follows You Home Posted on July 29, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply This week’s guest columnists are Drs. Michael Johnson and Sam Defigarelli, Family Practice residents at the University Hospital and Clinics here in Lafayette. The family returns from a cruise ship holiday in the Caribbean.  Everyone, including 10 year-old Gavin, had a blast.  He loved snorkeling, going down the waterslide on the ship, and even the exotic food at ports-of-call.  But even before the bags are unpacked at home, he says “Uh-Oh!” and runs to the bathroom, just in time for the watery explosion from below. Traveler’s Diarrhea is a condition that develops soon after returning from trips to resource-limited countries.  Gavin has three potential whammies in his scenario.  These countries often don’t have sewage treatment, and snorkeling is a potential contact with contaminated run-off.  Cruise ships and water-parks are known risks for catching diarrhea.  And improperly prepared food could make him sick as well. The biggest concern with diarrhea is dehydration.  Most only have a day or two of loose stools, but some also have nausea, vomiting, cramps, fever, or bloody stools.  When there’s lots of vomiting and diarrhea and worries about dehydration, kids should get seen. Most kids only need home treatment- plenty of clear fluids like pedialyte for infants, sports drinks or dilute juices for older kids.  Avoid full strength fruit juices- these can worsen diarrhea.  For copious diarrhea, rehydration solution packets are available at pharmacies, to mix with clean water.  If kids aren’t having cramps, nausea, or vomiting, they can eat and have milk.  Bland starchy foods are best- fast food and other heavy greasy food can prolong symptoms.  We say ”feed through diarrhea;” don’t restrict food if they’re hungry!  The sooner they eat, the sooner their guts get back in balance. You’ll want to control the spread of infection to you and your family, so that you aren’t cleaning up after multiple kids and feeling rotten yourself- a total nightmare!  Wash your hands frequently with soap and water- better than hand sanitizers.  Make sure kids aren’t touching or drinking after each other. Prevention while traveling is even better.  Only drink from unopened bottles.  Avoid ice- it could be made with contaminated water.  Eat food served hot, and avoid salads (ingredients washed how?).  And parents, alcohol won’t reliably sterilize water or ice, so avoid having your cold one on the rocks. Here is a different scenario than above. It’s June, the annual family reunion picnic, with all the aunts, uncles, and cousins . The grills are going and the sides have been put out: coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni salad.  There is a lot going on: pick-up football, pets running about, tables knocked over, umbrellas and chairs being set up, conversations all around.  The hamburgers are late getting on the grill and the sides have sat in the sun.  Everyone’s hungry so the burgers are a little under-done, but so what? Any dangerous situations in this story?  It’ not the football- it’s the mayonnaise-based sides warming in the sun, incubating bacteria like Staphylococcus.  And undercooked hamburger can contain E. coli, a potentially disastrous infection. Food poisoning is all too common in children.  Usually it’s just some diarrhea for a day or two and maybe some vomiting if your unlucky.  However, food poisoning with certain bacteria can have worse consequences.  Staphylococcus (a.k.a.”Staph”) often has a quick onset, within hours of ingestion, and can lead to dehydration and fatigue, especially in younger children.  There are many strains of E. coli too, the worst of which can lead to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, a deadly disease involving kidney failure and coma. Treatment of these bacteria infections isn’t just giving antibiotics.  In fact, sometimes antibiotics can make the symptoms worse.  There’s no treatment besides fluids and rest, and for the really sick kids, hospitalization.  So better to prevent infections than have them! Safe food handling is paramount.  Always cook meat thoroughly, particularly ground meat.  Be careful of your meat source- meat from a single farm, ground in the store, is much safer than meat from multiple feed lots, pre-ground and packaged when it gets to the store.  Never leave mayonnaise-containing food unrefrigerated for more than one hour.  Be sure to wash vegetables and fruits thoroughly- they might be from fields fertilized with manure that contains E. coli. So be careful when you travel, and when you cook at home.  An ounce of prevention is worth several pounds of diarrhea, when vacation follows you home! +++++++++++ Posted in Diarrhea , Traveling with Children | Leave a reply Screamin’ Down The Road- Traveling With Children Posted on February 18, 2014 by klfydoctor Reply On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the icy Potomac River in Washington during take-off.  Joe Stiley, one of the few survivors, saw the crash coming, seeing out his window how the plane was falling to the river.  He tucked into the “brace” position and told his secretary sitting next to him to do the same.  The plane crashed into a bridge and then into the Potomac.  Joe blacked out and awoke with the cabin full of water. He methodically unbuckled his seat belt, undid his secretary’s, and they swam to the exit and to the surface.  Joe was one of the few people who bothered to read the safety card every time he flew, note his nearest exit, and count how many seat rows to that exit. In disasters like these, surviving comes down to following safety instructions to the letter, immediately.  When you are flying, read that safety card every time.  Look up and find where your exits are.  Read how to open the emergency doors.  If the oxygen masks come down, put yours on first so you don’t black out before you can get your child’s on. Leave your luggage behind- trying to take it with you slows down everyone else’s exit. However, don’t be put off from air travel.  My family and I love to fly and it is as safe as sitting in your bedroom.  Disasters like above are very rare.  In fact, the most dangerous part of any flying trip is the car ride to the airport.  Most of us drive more when traveling with our families and cars are much, much more dangerous than airliners. So wear those seatbelts and buckle your kids into car seats properly.  Check your tires before long car trips.  And here are a few tips to keep your kids happier so they don’t distract from your driving.  Let them drink only water.  If kids drink soda or juice, they will have to take more bathroom stops.  With water, they only drink if they are truly thirsty. Have snacks and entertainment for them- DVDs, games, books.  On long drives my family loves books on tape.  We so enjoyed Harry Potter that even after an 8 hour car ride, we would sit in the driveway at home just to hear the end of a chapter. Hotels are another safety and comfort consideration.  At 5am one morning in a hotel in Mobile, the fire alarm went off.  Being well trained by their Emergency Dad, my family popped immediately out of bed and headed for the exit.  In fact Mr. Prepared was the last out, having a little trouble getting my shoes on.  We were all the way down the stairs before all-clear was called.  On our way back up, we were surprised how few other guests had even peaked out to see what was going on.  In a real fire, I sure like my family’s chances better than theirs. In her book The Unthinkable, Amanda Ripley shows how people survive disasters.  In airplanes it means following your safety card like Joe Stiley above.  In hotels it means practicing finding your exit, crawling on your hands and knees under smoke. Count the doors to the stairwell.  Go down the stairs- it’s fun to pop out and find yourself in some forgotten alley and make your way back.  Don’t stay above the fourth floor- that’s as high as Fire Department ladders reach, in case fire traps you in your room. Again, keeping your kids comfortable in hotels makes traveling more fun.  Use that hotel pool!  Exercise after sitting in a car all day will help them sleep.  Keep your usual routines- eat together, read bedtime stories, be calm and unfrustrated.  Bring comfort medicines- ibuprofen or tylenol for aches, cough drops for dry throats in dry hotel air.  Searching for a pharmacy at 11pm in an unfamiliar town is a real drag! So when traveling, be prepared.  Review and follow all safety tips.  Buckle up.  And don’t forget your bathing suits!

Posted on January 29, 2016 by klfydoctor Reply One of last year’s fun news stories was a 911 call from a man whose cat wouldn’t let him in his house.  After a three hour stand off, and after the police and 911 operator finished laughing themselves silly, an officer was dispatched and apparently talked the cat down. Similar absurdities happen in Emergency Medicine.  Once when I worked in Baltimore, a mom brought her child in for chapped lips.  Thinking that no one would come to the ED for such a minor thing, I searched for the “hidden agenda,” some underlying worry explaining mom’s thinking.  Like if her Uncle Frim had lip cancer and she feared her son had it too. However, after an exhaustive history, there was no such issue: her son simply had chapped lips. It’s sometimes difficult telling the public when to call 911 or not, and when to bring kids to the Emergency Department or not.  We want to encourage people to get emergency help so they don’t blow off potentially serious issues.  On the other hand, we don’t want the Emergency Department and EMS systems clogged with non-emergencies. Most pediatric ED visits are not emergencies, but families come for many reasons. First, parents get scared for their kids.  They love their kids and when they get sick or hurt, parents sometimes rush for help rather than call their doctor for advice or wait for an appointment. Often parents can’t get their kid seen in the office that day.  An appointment for next week doesn’t help when your child won’t stop vomiting, or needs x-rays.  Sometimes when the parent does call for advice, the mom is told to go to the ED, rather than office staff taking time to talk the situation through, giving advice that could keep the child home. Sometimes when a child gets sick or hurt, a doctor’s office or school is worried about caring for a potential emergency.  They aren’t used to emergencies and don’t want to miss something, or get sued. Almost daily we see kids in the Emergency Department who were in car crashes, seem fine, but the parents want them “checked out.”  You can’t fault this reasoning; they care about their kids and are worried.  However, when the “crash” involves cars backing into each other in a parking lot, and the child was strapped into a car seat, maybe an ED visit is overkill.  Unless the lot has cars speeding into their slots like the Indy 500 pit stop. Too often the ED is used as a walk-in clinic, rather than for true emergencies.  The point of this blog is to inform you about what real emergencies are, what can wait to see the doctor, and what you can take care of at home.  So let’s review common issues appropriate for the ED, and things that are not emergencies. Kids who are short of breath, tugging to breathe, belong in the ED.  Of course bring any children with possible broken bones, cuts that need stitches or won’t stop bleeding, or severe pain. When kids get lethargic (difficult to arouse), they need to get seen.  However, there are gradations of cuts and limb injuries, and lethargy: kids with fever get lethargic, but recover with anti-fever medicines.  If it isn’t obvious if it’s an emergency or not, call the doctor’s office.  If they can’t help, go to the column in this blog to the immediate right side of the page.  Click on your issue to read specifics about what is an emergency, and what can be handled at home. Things that are commonly not emergencies: fever, coughing, rashes.  Fever doesn’t hurt kids- it doesn’t cook their brains and is rarely associated with seizures.  The height of the fever doesn’t correlate with how sick the kid is either: a child with a 104 temperature isn’t sicker than a child with 101.  Coughing also isn’t an emergency- kids cough when they get colds and if they aren’t otherwise short of breath, it can wait.  Again, see the column to the right. This is a busy time of year for the Pediatric Emergency Departments, so use common sense when deciding to visit.  Use your doctor’s call line, or this blog when in doubt.  But if you still can’t decide, bring your child in. Better safe than sorry, but you can leave the chapped lips at home. Posted in Ambulance Calls , Appropriate ER visits , Fever | Leave a reply Non Emergencies in the Emergency Department Posted on December 27, 2013 by klfydoctor 4 I walk into the room, introduce myself, and ask my usual lead-in question: “When did things first start going wrong?”  The mom answers “She started with this rash last night, and this morning it has spread all over.  Just look at it!”  The mom yanks up the toddler’s shirt and sweeps her hand to show me the extent of the child’s scourge. And the child’s skin looks….normal.  I put on my reading glasses and peer closer.  Still, I am hard-pressed to identify anything that could be remotely called a rash.  The mom offers: “Its those bumps that worry me.”  Ah yes, I can see that the child’s skin has tiny bumps that at first you don’t notice, but alter the skin’s texture a little bit.  I straighten up, complete the rest of my history and physical, and inform the mom that no, the child does not have measles or chicken pox or flesh-eating bacteria, but a dry, irritated skin condition called eczema.  A change of soap, more lotion, and it should be fixed up in a few days. Winter is a busy time in the Pediatric Emergency Department.  Bronchiolitis makes babies cough, influenza makes all ages feel and look miserable, and asthmatics wheeze.  Kids are kept indoors by the cold and cough on each other and spread the contagion.  Emergency Departments and doctor’s offices are filled to the brim with sick children.  And then everybody waits longer to see the harried practitioners. The majority of theses illnesses involve coughs and fevers.  Fevers and coughs are not emergencies, and there are some simple things to know that can keep you from having to wait for hours in the Emergency Department or at your doctor’s.  Fever itself is not an emergency.  Fevers do not harm your child- they do not cook kid’s brains and they rarely cause seizures.  Fever is actually one of the body’s natural mechanisms to fight illness- fever is a good thing!  When your body senses that you are sick, it sets your brain thermostat higher.  The higher body temperature makes it harder for infection to grow in you, and your immune system can get on top of the infection. What is more important with fever is how the kid is acting with the fever.  Certainly the child will be tired and miserable, but that is easily treated with medicines like ibuprofen (motrin, advil) or acetaminophen (tylenol, pediacare).  As long as your child is drinking some, breathing comfortably, and is mentally “with it,” your child is doing okay. Most fevers are caused by viruses that will pass in a few days without need for a prescription. Likewise, most coughs are not emergencies.  Sure, coughs are irritating, particularly at night when everyone wants to go to sleep.  But as long as the child is breathing comfortably, then home remedies are as good (or better!) than any prescription.  Put your kid to bed with their his head elevated, get the vaporizer going next to the bed, put on some Vicks-Vaporub.  Give some ibuprofen or tylenol to ease that scratchy throat.  Don’t waste your money on cough syrups- science has shown over and over that they don’t work. There is no prescription that reliably helps coughs either.  Everyday I get parents who ask for a prescription for colds.  As I tell them, no one has invented any medicine that helps dry up runny noses or suppresses cough.  Doctors sometimes prescribe anti-histamines, codeine, or other things, but these medicines rarely help and often cause more trouble than they are worth.  They can make a child more awake and antsy and irritable, and the kid still coughs! So please don’t be like the mom above and rush to the Emergency Department when your child has a rash or a fever or a cough.  We are busy enough with the children who are lethargic or working hard to breathe, with kids with broken arms and head injuries and lacerated faces.  Long lines of the non-emergent just makes everyone wait longer, only to be told the things that could have been done at home.  If you are not sure, call your doctor to see if you should come to the office or come to the ER.  Do your part to keep non-emergencies out of the Emergency Department. Posted in Appropriate ER visits | 4 Replies The ER Is NOT for Colds and Diaper Rashes! Posted on March 4, 2011 by klfydoctor Reply It is a busy time of year for us in the ER business.  Besides the usual injuries and illnesses, people fill the ERs in the evenings with worries that are NOT emergencies.  The waiting rooms are clogged with milling crowds, often irate because of long waits, passing germs to each other, and most of those people could have stayed home and been fine. Why are our evenings so busy?  People get off work, come home to a sick child; now the doctor’s office is closed, so they bring the sick child (no matter how minor the illness) to the ER.  Also, there is something about when the sun goes down that increases people’s worries.  Minor illnesses are blown up to big worries in parents’ minds at night.  Doctors’ phone services are also to blame.  When some parents call their doctors at night, rather than go into a thorough conversation that can figure out the problem and help the family stay at home, the doctor or nurse just say “go to the ER.” Here is a list of minor illnesses that should NOT be brought to an EMERGENCY department.  When families with these complaints check in, other childrens’ care will be delayed while we wade through these non-emergencies: rashes (especially diaper rashes!  In an Emergency Department?!), fever, cough and runny nose, sprains that the patient can walk on, car accidents that happened on a previous day, toothaches, pregnancy tests, diarrhea, vomiting only once or twice or less than a few hours, pink eye, pinworms, ear pain, sore throat.  All of the above should wait to see your regular doctor the next day. Here are some of the emergency versions of the above: shortness of breath, fever with worsening fatigue, abdominal pain with worsening vomiting and poor drinking, fever in a baby less than 3 months old, injury with deformity or inability to walk, worsening headaches with any of these. This evening, do yourself and your ER workers a favor: call your doctor before coming to the crowded ER and waiting hours, if you are not sure if your child’s condition is an emergency. Also, you can look to this blog to read about common illnesses and injuries, and how you can take care of things at home (look to the Categories column on the right side of this page).  All the entries here talk about what can be taken care of at home, and how, and what makes your child’s problem a real emergency.
