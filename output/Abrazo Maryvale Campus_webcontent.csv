Stroke is the No. 5 cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability in the United States. On average, someone in the U.S. suffers a stroke every 40 seconds, someone dies of a stroke every four minutes, and nearly 800,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke each year, according to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association. “A stroke patient loses 1.9 million neurons each minute stroke treatment is delayed. The recognition from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Stroke further his recognition further demonstrates our team’s hard work and commitment to delivering advanced stroke treatments to patients quickly and safely,” said Frank Molinaro, Market Chief Executive Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network . To help raise awareness about stroke, Abrazo is hosting free stroke health checks in May. StrokeCheck includes glucose, blood pressure and heart rate, body mass index, review of family history and risk factor assessment, stroke education and materials and counseling with a licensed medical professional. Participants are requested to bring a list of current medications and recent lab work to the sessions. For the glucose screening, please fast 6-8 hours prior to the test. If you have not fasted, the test will not be performed. To register, go to AbrazoHealth.com/StrokeHealth or call 844-361-8285. The national award recognizes the Abrazo hospitals’ commitment to providing the most appropriate stroke treatment according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines based on the latest scientific evidence. Hospitals must achieve 85 percent or higher adherence to all Get With The Guidelines-Stroke achievement indicators for two or more consecutive 12-month periods and achieve 75 percent or higher compliance with five of eight Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Quality measures to receive the Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award. The hospitals also had met specific scientific guidelines as a Primary Stroke Center, featuring a system for rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients admitted to the emergency department.

Abrazo Maryvale Campus augmented the Heat Relief Effort water drive coordinated by Central Arizona Shelter Services and the Phoenix Fire Department. Abrazo Maryvale Campus Chief Executive Officer Crystal Hamilton said she was impressed by the generosity of staff and community members during the hospital’s annual water drive. “We collected water as a way to help keep people cool and hydrated as well as to build awareness surrounding dehydration prevention,” Hamilton said. J. David Smith, Communications Manager for CASS, said the Abrazo Maryvale Campus water drive is greatly appreciated. ""Abrazo Maryvale Campus's efforts to help CASS keep the homeless hydrated couldn't come at a more critical time.  Our community members experiencing homelessness are 10 times more likely to die from heat-related illness than other residents of Maricopa County."" Phoenix Vice Mayor Daniel Valenzuela said he applauds Abrazo Maryvale Campus’ assistance with the water drive. “There are a lot of people out there who are less fortunate who treat a bottle of water like it is a luxury,” Valenzuela said. “Collection efforts like these help to ensure drinking water is never a luxury and is always freely available to all who need it.""

Abrazo Maryvale Campus Chief Executive Officer Crystal Hamilton and Phoenix City Councilman David Valenzuela will kick off the water drive at 8 a.m. June 29 in the hospital’s lobby, 5102 W. Campbell Ave.  Abrazo Maryvale Campus will be augmenting the Heat Relief Effort water drive coordinated by Central Arizona Shelter Services. (CASS) and Phoenix firefighters to help those in need while raising awareness of the dangers faced by the homeless during the summer heat. “Arizona's harsh summer weather conditions can be devastating to people who are unable to avoid them for long periods of time,’’ Hamilton said.  “Dehydration is a major concern during the summer months. We are collecting water as a way to help keep people cool and hydrated as well as build awareness surrounding dehydration prevention.” Dr. Pierre Gilles, a general surgeon on staff at Abrazo Maryvale Campus, said hydration plays a key role in optimal management of renal disease, diabetes, hypertension and other medical issues. “The more we focus on hydrating on a daily basis by drinking 8 to 12 glasses of water a day and increase that number if there is going to be any significant outdoor activities. This decreases the risk we have of compromising our overall health,” he said. J. David Smith, Communications Manager for CASS, said the Abrazo Maryvale Campus water drive is greatly appreciated. ""Abrazo Maryvale Campus's efforts to help CASS keep the homeless hydrated couldn't come at a more critical time.  Our community members experiencing homelessness are 10 times more likely to die from heat-related illness than other residents of Maricopa County."" Water bottles can be dropped off during business hours at the third floor lobby of Abrazo Maryvale Campus, 5102 W. Campbell Ave. from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Water also can be donated from                   8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday at Abrazo Medical Group Maryvale Specialty Group, 4524 N. Maryvale Parkway., Suite. 220; and Abrazo Medical Group West Olive, 5112 W Olive Ave., Suite C-113 in Glendale. Valenzuela said he appreciates Abrazo Maryvale Campus’ assistance with the water drive. “There are a lot of people out there who are less fortunate who treat a bottle of water like it is a luxury,” Valenzuela said. “Collection efforts like these help to ensure drinking water is never a luxury and is always freely available to all who need it.""

The donations were collected at nine Abrazo facilities as part of the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive which ended June 9. Abrazo West Campus and Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center staff and community members donated cereal and Partners for Health donated $500 to Agua Fria Food Bank.  Abrazo Maryvale Campus staff and community members donated cereal to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance received donations from staff and community members at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital, Abrazo Arrowhead Campus, Abrazo Central Campus, Abrazo Community Health Network’s Regional Office, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo Peoria Emergency Center. When 11-year-old Brityn Hasl heard that Abrazo Arrowhead Campus was collecting cereal for hungry children, she decided to help.  The Peoria resident collected 110 boxes of cereal by making phone calls and posting a plea on her mother’s Facebook page. Her mother, Brannan Hasl, is an Abrazo Arrowhead Campus nurse. “I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to wonder when I would eat again. I was able to make sure quite a few kids would be able to have breakfast all summer,’’ said Brityn. The Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive’s purpose is to feed hungry children during the summer months when they don’t have access to school meals. ""At Abrazo Community Health Network, our goal is not only to help patients get well but also to help our community understand and take control of their health,"" said Market Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Ellert. ""Part of this includes recognizing the importance of good nutrition. Through this drive, we can help those who are struggling with food insecurity."" Arizona ranks third in the country for high child food insecurity rates, behind only New Mexico and Mississippi, with 456,760 children facing hunger on a daily basis, according to St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance. “We appreciate Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals for hosting the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive,’’ said Jerry Brown, director of public relations for St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance.  “Summer is a particularly difficult time for our food bank because many children can no longer rely on their schools for meals so their families often turn to us for help. Thanks to Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals and the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive, many families will have a healthy breakfast.’’ To make an even greater impact this year, Tenet Healthcare is matching all financial donations made as part of the cereal drives at Abrazo hospitals and other Tenet facilities nationally up to $100,000 collectively to provide perishable breakfast items such as milk, lean protein and fruit. For every $1 donation, five meals can be provided by food banks. Whole-grain cereal, when part of a healthy, balanced breakfast including dairy (such as milk and yogurt), fruit and lean protein, is a popular food item that experts say can easily address the hunger gap during the summer months when children are not in school. Healthy cereal contains one serving of whole grain, no more than 200 calories per serving, six grams or less of sugar and at least three grams of fiber per serving. It should also be free of artificial colors and dyes.

        }); Home >> Our Locations >> Abrazo Maryvale Campus >> CEO Welcome Abrazo Maryvale Campus CEO Welcome We welcome you to Abrazo Maryvale Campus , a satellite of Abrazo West Campus.  For over 50 years, Abrazo Maryvale Campus has served our community providing outstanding, quality patient care. Maryvale is a very special place and I am honored to lead such a wonderful team of individuals.  The people who work at Maryvale want to work at Maryvale. Our physicians and staff are dedicated to providing care to this underserved community.  We believe that every patient should receive high quality care and be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, irrespective of their circumstances.  Our team is committed to that goal.   We all work very hard but are rewarded through every patient, family member and employee who we serve. Maryvale is an affiliate of Abrazo Community Health Network. Maryvale has been recognized for three years in a row as one of the Joint Commission’s top performing hospitals in Core Measures/Quality outcomes.  The first year of this recognition, we were the only Phoenix hospital that was recognized.  We are certified in the care of Stroke and Chest Pain patients. Our Emergency Department cares for nearly 50,000 patients each year.  We are also growing our General Surgery Service line with many other plans for expansion of service lines. Our Senior Track Emergency Room bays are specially designed for the comfort of our older patients. Many hospitals say they are a community hospital. Maryvale is a community hospital.  For example, within our hospital we have teenagers from our community who are working on their high school diplomas in our Community Education Center.  We look for every opportunity we can to be involved in and serve our community’s needs. It is rare that someone wants to go to a hospital, but it is my hope that if you need healthcare you will trust us with that care.  The Maryvale team is dedicated to making what can be an unpleasant experience as positive as possible. If you are looking for a job and want to work somewhere where you can make a significant difference in people’s lives every day you come to work, I hope you will consider working at Maryvale. Thank you for your time and I look forward to having you as part of our Maryvale family.

Heart disease remains the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year. About 85.6 million Americans are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke, according to the American Heart Association. “Health education and disease prevention should be top priorities for patients and their caregivers. At Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals, we are deeply committed to helping patients and their loved ones understand the risks associated with heart disease so they can seize control of their health,’’ said Timothy Byrne, Market Medical Director for Cardiology for Abrazo Community Health Network The health screenings will be at the Abrazo booth at the Phoenix Heart Walk which will be held at CityScape, 318 W. Washington St. Cholesterol and glucose screenings will be provided from 8-11 a.m. and blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) checks will be available from 8 a.m. to noon. For glucose, please fast for six to eight hours prior to this test for accurate results. Healthcare professionals will be on hand to answer questions.  Stroke, heart disease, diabetes and other educational materials will be provided. Abrazo Community Health Network is the Phoenix Heart Walk’s Year-Round Cause sponsor. Hundreds of Abrazo Community Health Network employees will be participating in this year’s Phoenix Heart Walk. Last year, Abrazo was the top fundraising company with about $95,000 in donations.

See our hospital in action Words can only say so much—when you’re deciding which hospital to visit, you should see the medical team in action. Our Services Accredited Chest Pain Center When you experience chest pain, every second counts.

Learn More Diagnostic Imaging You can get a fast, accurate diagnosis thanks to on-site digital imaging services such as MRI and ultrasound. Our advanced digital imaging department stays open around the clock, so you can get the results you need, when you need them. Learn More Emergency & Trauma Find fast, effective emergency care at our Level II Emergency Department. You get medical attention without a long wait—if your condition is not life threatening, you can spend even less time in the waiting room using our online check-in system that lets you check in and wait at home. Learn More Heart Care You don’t have to wait for a heart attack to do something about your heart health. The cardiovascular specialists at Abrazo Maryvale Campus can help diagnose heart problems and provide minimally invasive treatments to help prevent heart disease before it’s too late. Learn More Mother & Newborn Abrazo Maryvale Campus closed its obstetrics and delivery services on August 14, 2015 and does not admit OB patients.

Learn More Rehabilitation Surgery or treatment for an injury is often only the beginning of the healing process. Many treatments require follow up rehabilitation to help you build strength, mobility and a healthier lifestyle. Our rehab services include inpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech/language pathology, so we can help you recover as quickly as possible. ​ Learn More It can be hard in the ICU, because patients are very sick and families are scared. But when they leave, they tell us how accommodating we were, and what great care they got. They tell other people about us, even though those people hopefully will never be in the ICU. It’s a good day when we have made a difference, however small, to a patient or a family member who is troubled. We want every day to matter to them, so it matters to us. Making that human connection — that’s what makes it all worthwhile. — Courtney Standifird, Clinical Coordinator, Maryvale ICU CEO Welcome Our Services & Specialties Careers Classes & Events Awards & Distinctions ER Online Check-In Pay Your Bill Online My Health Rec - Patient Portal Our News Find A Physician Emergency Senior Care Choose Your Time Non-life threatening emergency?

The water bottles were donated on June 21 to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. “Arizona's harsh summer weather conditions can be devastating to people who are unable to avoid them for long periods of time,’’ said Dr. Greg Sexton, medical director of the Abrazo Maryvale Campus Emergency Department.  “ Dehydration is a major concern during the summer months. We collected water as a way to help keep people cool and hydrated as well as build awareness surrounding dehydration prevention.” Dwight Amery, Maryvale Revitalization Corp. president, said that the water drive will help homeless individuals and others who are out in the sun for longer periods of time. ""The Abrazo Maryvale Campus donation of water bottles couldn't come at a more critical time with our record high temperatures,’’ Emery said.

""If not handled properly, fireworks can cause severe injuries to eyes and skin. Even just watching a friend light fireworks can put you at risk,'' said William Ellert, Market Chief Medical Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 10,000 firework-related injuries happened in 2014. Of these, 67 percent occurred in the 30 days surrounding July 4. In addition, children ages 5 to 9 years old experienced a higher injury rate than other age groups. It is incredibly important to make sure that children do not handle fireworks, Dr. Ellert said. Even fireworks sold at a grocery store, such as sparklers or other small novelties, are just as dangerous. Bottle rockets and sparklers, which can burn at more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, accounted for nearly 40 percent of all estimated injuries in 2013. While the best way to prevent these types of injuries is to leave the show to the experts, if you or a friend chooses to handle fireworks, the National Council on Firework Safety offers these tips: Use fireworks outdoors only. Obey local laws. If fireworks are not legal where you live, do not use them. Always have water handy. Only use fireworks as intended. Don't try to alter them or combine them. Use common sense. Spectators should keep a safe distance and wear safety glasses. Alcohol and fireworks do not mix. Have a ""designated shooter."" Do not use homemade fireworks. Report illegal explosives to the fire or police department in your community of all estimated injuries in 2013. For non-life threatening emergencies, Abrazo Community Health Network’s six hospitals and two free-standing Emergency Departments offer a free online service for patients which projects timetables to be seen by a doctor. This allows patients to wait at home rather than in the ER. Go to findERtime.com for more information.

The donations were collected at nine Abrazo facilities as part of the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive which ended June 10. St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance received donations from staff and community members at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital, Abrazo Arrowhead Campus, Abrazo Central Campus, Abrazo Community Health Network’s Regional Office, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo Peoria Emergency Center. In addition, Abrazo West Campus and Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center staff and community members along with Partners for Health and the Medical Executive Committee donated to Agua Fria Food Bank.  Abrazo Maryvale Campus staff and community members donated to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. The Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive’s purpose is to feed hungry children as they head in to summer months without the benefit of a healthy breakfast, often provided by their school. ""At Abrazo Community Health Network, our goal is not only to help patients get well but also to help our community understand and take control of their health,"" said Market Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Ellert. ""Part of this includes recognizing the importance of good nutrition. Through this drive, we can help those who are struggling with food insecurity."" Arizona ranks third in the country for high child food insecurity rates, behind only New Mexico and Mississippi, with 456,760 children facing hunger on a daily basis, according to St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance. “We appreciate Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals for hosting the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive,’’ said Jerry Brown, director of public relations for St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance.  “Summer is a particularly difficult time for our food bank because many children can no longer rely on their schools for meals so their families often turn to us for help. Thanks to Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals and the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive, many families will have a healthy breakfast.’’ To make an even greater impact this year, Tenet Healthcare is matching all financial donations made as part of the cereal drives at Abrazo hospitals and other Tenet facilities nationally up to $100,000 collectively to provide perishable breakfast items such as milk, lean protein and fruit. For every $1 donation, five meals can be provided by food banks. Whole-grain cereal, when part of a healthy, balanced breakfast including dairy (such as milk and yogurt), fruit and lean protein, is a popular food item that experts say can easily address the hunger gap during the summer months when children are not in school. Healthy cereal contains one serving of whole grain, no more than 200 calories per serving, six grams or less of sugar and at least three grams of fiber per serving. It should also be free of artificial colors and dyes.

More than 430 Abrazo employees were registered for the walk. “The participation from our Abrazo employees was amazing and inspiring,’’ said Frank Molinaro, Market Chief Executive Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. “Through collaboration and compassion, we were able to raise more than $71,000 for such a great cause.” Abrazo Community Health Network is also the Phoenix Heart Walk’s year-round cause sponsor, the largest sponsorship of the 2017 Phoenix Heart Walk, and Abrazo Central Campus was the Stroke Mile sponsor.

I would like to thank everyone who participated this year whether at the hospital events, at the Phoenix Heart Walk or supporting one of our teams.’’  Biggs said.

This voluntary certification means that Abrazo Maryvale Campus, 5102 W. Campbell Ave., is ready to provide emergency care resources and capabilities for pediatric patients every day. If necessary, Abrazo Maryvale Campus can stabilize critically ill or injured children for transfer to a facility that offers more specialized pediatric care. More than 30 percent of Abrazo Maryvale Campus patients are under 18 years old. “Abrazo Maryvale Campus physicians and staff are committed to providing quality emergency care to pediatric patients. Abrazo Maryvale has always taken care of pediatric patients.  The new Pediatric Preparedness certification is an additional accolade for our ED team and allows the ED nurses to take advantage of national pediatric training opportunities with the new Pediatric Preparedness certification. The preparedness survey enabled us to show that our performance meets the academy’s pediatric-focused, emergency care standards,” said Crystal Hamilton, Abrazo Maryvale Campus Chief Executive Officer. To receive this voluntary certification, an emergency room must pass a broad and in-depth review of pediatric care readiness that includes its equipment, clinical and administrative staffing, policies and procedures and analytics, said Dr. John Pope, board president of Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “The Arizona Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics believes in access to optimal emergency care for all children,’’ Pope said. Arizona is among five states to implement a pediatric emergency care system. Certification is a quality improvement process that includes matching hospital capabilities and capacity to established guidelines through a self-assessment process and a site visit by a team of peer professionals. Pediatric Prepared Emergency Care is a private-public partnership among hospitals, health care professionals, emergency personnel and state agencies throughout Arizona, committed to an effective regionalized pediatric emergency care system. Since 2008, the Arizona Department of Health Services Office of Injury Prevention along with the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics has spearheaded the effort to launch the pediatric emergency department certification/regionalized system.  In 2010, AzAAP established the certification, and currently conducts certification reviews and offers continuing pediatric emergency education. The Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics is an organization of more than 1,100 primary care pediatricians, pediatric specialists, nurses and other pediatric healthcare providers dedicated to the health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults.

The recognition from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Stroke further reinforces our team’s hard work and our commitment to delivering advanced stroke treatments to patients quickly and safely,” said Crystal Hamilton, Abrazo Maryvale Campus Chief Executive Officer.

        }); Home >> Our Locations >> Abrazo Maryvale Campus >> Our News >> Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year PHOENIX (Dec. 9, 2016) –You better watch out, you better not ask why but it’s time to get honest about this jolly old guy. Santa Claus is one of the most beloved and recognized figures in the world. Also well-known are his sometimes unhealthy habits and lifestyle – like his weight. Jolly old St. Nicholas, lean your ear this way. Abrazo Community Health Network has health advice to help keep you healthy throughout the New Year. 1. Overweight: Symptoms: Mid-section shakes like “bowlful of jelly” Concerns: Heart & vascular disease, obesity Recommendation: Santa Claus’s extra weight puts him at risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and stroke. Lay off the sweets, hit the gym and look into a weight loss program. 2. Bad Knees & Back: Cause: Slinging sacks of toys up and down chimneys, arthritis from age Recommendation: Enroll in a weight control programs and head to the gym. It might be time Santa looked in to a possible knee replacement. 3. Nose like a Cherry: Concerns: Could be a sign of eczema, rosacea, wind burn, sun burn or frost bite Recommendation: An annual skin cancer screening or a visit to the dermatologist is suggested. Check for allergies to reindeer, mistletoe and holly. Also, rosacea is often triggered by alcohol so lay off the spiked egg nog. 4. Infectious Diseases: Cause: Working in close proximity with under-the-weather elves and reindeer Recommendation: The best stay-well winter strategy is a flu shot. Keep the stables clean and wash hands often when working with animals. 5. Diabetes: Cause: Christmas cookie diet, obesity Recommendation: Try grabbing fresh fruit or share some carrot sticks with the reindeer instead of giving into the Christmas Eve cravings. Getting out for regular walks with Mrs. Clause will help Santa stay away from a sedentary life which can make diabetes worse. 6. Lung Cancer: Cause: Corn-cob pipe smoking, exposure to large amounts of chimney soot Recommendation: Stop smoking immediately.  Find alternative means of access to dwellings when delivering presents. 7. Snoring: Cause: Restless sleep due to worry over elf productivity in the workshop Recommendation: Take part in a sleep study to make sure snoring isn’t a result of sleep apnea. 8. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Cause: He makes lots of lists and he checks them twice Recommendation: Dictate text with speech-recognition software on your computer or talk to Siri on your iPhone to minimalize stress on hands and wrists. 9. Sleigh & Chimney Safety: Concerns: Wounds from constantly bumping into the sleigh, roof-tops and chimneys Recommendation: Chronic wounds can get worse when coupled with diabetes, circulatory problems and immobilization brought on by sitting in a sleigh for long periods. Infection control and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are some of the things that help with healing. 10. Psychological Problems: Manifestation: Unreasonably jolly all the time Indication: “North Polar Disorder” Recommendation: Immediate evaluation by a mental health professional If you, like Santa, need a healthcare provider, Abrazo Community Health Network’s affiliated general practitioners, cardiologists, bariatric surgeons, vascular surgeons, internists and orthopedic surgeons can help.  Call our Physician Referral Line at 1-877-934-9355 to find a physician.
