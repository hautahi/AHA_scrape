The donations were collected at nine Abrazo facilities as part of the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive which ended June 9. Abrazo West Campus and Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center staff and community members donated cereal and Partners for Health donated $500 to Agua Fria Food Bank.  Abrazo Maryvale Campus staff and community members donated cereal to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance received donations from staff and community members at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital, Abrazo Arrowhead Campus, Abrazo Central Campus, Abrazo Community Health Network’s Regional Office, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo Peoria Emergency Center. When 11-year-old Brityn Hasl heard that Abrazo Arrowhead Campus was collecting cereal for hungry children, she decided to help.  The Peoria resident collected 110 boxes of cereal by making phone calls and posting a plea on her mother’s Facebook page. Her mother, Brannan Hasl, is an Abrazo Arrowhead Campus nurse. “I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to wonder when I would eat again. I was able to make sure quite a few kids would be able to have breakfast all summer,’’ said Brityn. The Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive’s purpose is to feed hungry children during the summer months when they don’t have access to school meals. ""At Abrazo Community Health Network, our goal is not only to help patients get well but also to help our community understand and take control of their health,"" said Market Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Ellert. ""Part of this includes recognizing the importance of good nutrition. Through this drive, we can help those who are struggling with food insecurity."" Arizona ranks third in the country for high child food insecurity rates, behind only New Mexico and Mississippi, with 456,760 children facing hunger on a daily basis, according to St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance. “We appreciate Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals for hosting the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive,’’ said Jerry Brown, director of public relations for St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance.  “Summer is a particularly difficult time for our food bank because many children can no longer rely on their schools for meals so their families often turn to us for help. Thanks to Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals and the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive, many families will have a healthy breakfast.’’ To make an even greater impact this year, Tenet Healthcare is matching all financial donations made as part of the cereal drives at Abrazo hospitals and other Tenet facilities nationally up to $100,000 collectively to provide perishable breakfast items such as milk, lean protein and fruit. For every $1 donation, five meals can be provided by food banks. Whole-grain cereal, when part of a healthy, balanced breakfast including dairy (such as milk and yogurt), fruit and lean protein, is a popular food item that experts say can easily address the hunger gap during the summer months when children are not in school. Healthy cereal contains one serving of whole grain, no more than 200 calories per serving, six grams or less of sugar and at least three grams of fiber per serving. It should also be free of artificial colors and dyes.

The Leapfrog Group Hospital Safety Score is a rating system designed to give consumers information they can use to make healthcare decisions for themselves or a loved one. The Leapfrog Group assigns A, B, C, D and F grades to more than 2,600 U.S. hospitals based on their ability to prevent errors, injuries, accidents, and infections. “This recognition is a result of our colleagues continually raising the bar on the quality of care we deliver to the metropolitan Phoenix community,” said Stan Holm, Abrazo West Campus Chief Executive Officer.  “Our employees and physicians know that every patient should be treated as if they were a part of their own family, and our ‘A’ rating reflects this commitment.” About Abrazo Abrazo Community Health Network embraces patients with the compassion of a friend while delivering the best-in-class care of a comprehensive health network.

Molinaro, who will continue to serve as CEO of Abrazo Arrowhead Campus/Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital and Abrazo Central Campus, will oversee the operations of the six-hospital system, which also includes Abrazo Maryvale Campus, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo West Campus. Michele Finney, who has led the successful development of Abrazo Community Health Network since 2014, has been named CEO of Tenet Healthcare’s three-hospital Desert market in California, which includes Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, JFK Memorial Hospital in Indio and Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree. “We have already made significant progress in developing our integrated healthcare system in Phoenix,” said Jeffrey Koury, CEO of Tenet’s Western Region. “Frank is a dynamic, talented leader who will work collaboratively with our hospital management teams in developing coordinated service lines, enhancing access to high-quality healthcare, and focusing on our most important mission – providing an outstanding patient experience at our hospitals.” Molinaro has served as CEO at Abrazo Arrowhead Campus since 2011. He was named CEO of Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital in 2015, when the hospital became a satellite campus of Abrazo Arrowhead. In 2016, he was also given responsibility for leading Abrazo Central Campus. During his tenure at Abrazo Arrowhead/Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital, Molinaro helped lead the combined facilities to exceptional results, particularly in the areas of quality and patient satisfaction.  Under his leadership, Abrazo Arrowhead earned an “A” rating from The Leapfrog Group two years in a row, as well as a Tenet Circle of Excellence Award, Truven Health Top 50 Cardiovascular Hospitals designation, and a Joint Commission Top Performer award, all in 2014.  In 2016, Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital was one of only two hospitals across the company to receive Tenet’s award for Outstanding Improvement in Patient Satisfaction. “I am excited to be given this opportunity to help drive Abrazo Community Health Network forward and build on the progress we have already made over the last several years under Michele’s leadership,” Molinaro said. “I look forward to working with all of my Abrazo Community Health Network colleagues to fulfill our unified goal of consistently providing high-quality, compassionate care to Phoenix residents.” The CEOs at Abrazo Maryvale Campus, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo West Campus will now report to Molinaro.

Abrazo Community Health Network was the highest fundraiser among healthcare companies and was the second highest company fundraiser overall of about 130 companies participating in the 24 rd annual Phoenix Heart Walk which attracted 20,000 participants on March 18. More than 430 Abrazo employees were registered for the walk. “The participation from our Abrazo employees was amazing and inspiring,’’ said Frank Molinaro, Market Chief Executive Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. “Through collaboration and compassion, we were able to raise more than $71,000 for such a great cause.” Abrazo Community Health Network is also the Phoenix Heart Walk’s year-round cause sponsor, the largest sponsorship of the 2017 Phoenix Heart Walk, and Abrazo Central Campus was the Stroke Mile sponsor. Tami Biggs, Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital Chief Operating Officer, helped champion the 2017 Phoenix Heart Walk. “Our mission in our personal lives as well as our work lives is to champion exceptional healthcare to those whose lives we touch. I would like to thank everyone who participated this year whether at the hospital events, at the Phoenix Heart Walk or supporting one of our teams.’’  Biggs said.

The water bottles were donated on June 21 to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. “Arizona's harsh summer weather conditions can be devastating to people who are unable to avoid them for long periods of time,’’ said Dr. Greg Sexton, medical director of the Abrazo Maryvale Campus Emergency Department.  “ Dehydration is a major concern during the summer months. We collected water as a way to help keep people cool and hydrated as well as build awareness surrounding dehydration prevention.” Dwight Amery, Maryvale Revitalization Corp. president, said that the water drive will help homeless individuals and others who are out in the sun for longer periods of time. ""The Abrazo Maryvale Campus donation of water bottles couldn't come at a more critical time with our record high temperatures,’’ Emery said.

Heart disease remains the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year. About 85.6 million Americans are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke, according to the American Heart Association. “Health education and disease prevention should be top priorities for patients and their caregivers. At Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals, we are deeply committed to helping patients and their loved ones understand the risks associated with heart disease so they can seize control of their health,’’ said Timothy Byrne, Market Medical Director for Cardiology for Abrazo Community Health Network The health screenings will be at the Abrazo booth at the Phoenix Heart Walk which will be held at CityScape, 318 W. Washington St. Cholesterol and glucose screenings will be provided from 8-11 a.m. and blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) checks will be available from 8 a.m. to noon. For glucose, please fast for six to eight hours prior to this test for accurate results. Healthcare professionals will be on hand to answer questions.  Stroke, heart disease, diabetes and other educational materials will be provided. Abrazo Community Health Network is the Phoenix Heart Walk’s Year-Round Cause sponsor. Hundreds of Abrazo Community Health Network employees will be participating in this year’s Phoenix Heart Walk. Last year, Abrazo was the top fundraising company with about $95,000 in donations.

The water bottles were donated on June 16 to All Faith Community Services Food Bank which serves the West Valley. The water drive included the Abrazo West Campus Medical Executive committee and The Partners for Health, a nonprofit organization that supports healthcare needs of the communities served by Abrazo West Campus.  Abrazo Buckeye Fire Department firefighters helped load the bottles of water for delivery to the food bank. “Arizona's harsh summer weather conditions can be devastating to people who are unable to avoid them for long periods of time,’’ said Dr. Brian Dursteler, medical director of the Abrazo West Campus Emergency Department.  “Dehydration is a major concern during the summer months. We collected water as a way to help keep people cool and hydrated as well as build awareness surrounding dehydration prevention.” Abrazo West Campus surpassed last year’s donation of 36,000 bottles of water. Cassie Wilkins, All Faith Community Services Chief Executive Officer, said that the water drive will help homeless individuals and others who are out in the sun for longer periods of time. “With the severe heat we are now encountering, we have begun to already put it to work.  The water will in fact help those who are homeless and need to stop by our location to rehydrate and take some with them.  We will also be providing it in our emergency food boxes.  We serve more than 2,000 households per month or over 10,000 individuals.  We anticipate the water drive will help us get to the end of July when children will go back to school and the need will not be so great,’’ she said. Other groups that helped with the water drive are Sysco Foods, Best Western Scottsdale and Girl Scouts.

Many have been through it themselves, and they’ve helped thousands of women bring happy, healthy babies into the world. So they understand you may feel nervous or uncertain, and that you probably have a lot of questions. To help answer many of the most common questions, we offer a lineup of helpful classes and events, including tours of our Mother and Newborn care center, breastfeeding classes, and childbirth education.

I commend our associates for seeking ways to embrace our community neighbors. I’m also proud of their passion to touch lives.’’ Bottles of water can be dropped off at Abrazo West Campus, 13677 W. McDowell Road in Goodyear; and the Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center, 525 S. Watson Road in Buckeye.  In addition, monetary donations for the water drive can be made at the Abrazo West Campus Gift Shop. Donations will be given to All Faith Community Services Food Bank and Resource Center which is a Buckeye-based nonprofit group that provides emergency food supplies, clothing and basic necessities to individuals and families.

This is the highest award in the nation bestowed on volunteers who have donated at least 4,000 hours during their lifetime. Abrazo West Campus Chief Executive Officer Stan Holm presented the award on April 19 to Treanor during the hospital’s annual volunteer awards luncheon. The Litchfield Park resident received a letter from President Obama, a President’s Call to Service Award Certificate and a pin to commemorate the event for donating at least 4,000 hours as of 2016. “This is an amazing accomplishment that these volunteers are being honored by the President of the United States,’’ Holm said. “Throughout the year, volunteers play a key role at Abrazo West Campus, helping out day to day and giving our patients a sense of community and a personal touch that lets them know their neighbors care.’’ Treanor, 78, has donated more than 4,200 hours at Abrazo West Campus since 2005 working an average of 8 hours per week. His smiling face greets visitors when they arrive at the hospital’s Front Desk seeking assistance. “A lot of people come into the hospital nervous because they don’t know where their loved one is and they don’t know where to go. When I help them, I feel good about what I’m doing,’’ Treanor said. He has watched the hospital grow over the years to its current 188 rooms as well as adding new services such as the Level 1 Trauma Center. “Eamon goes the extra mile and never gives up until he exhausts all options when he is helping someone. He is very reliable and I can count on him to be there on Mondays and Wednesdays,’’ said Dawn Gileau, Abrazo West Campus volunteer director. More volunteers are needed at the hospital, 13677 W. McDowell Road. Volunteers can help in a variety of ways such as helping to escort family members, serve at the Concierge Desk, provide golf cart shuttle service and help in the ER waiting area. They also can perform clerical duties, help at the surgical waiting guest relation desks and work in the gift shop. If you are interested in volunteering, contact Gileau at 623-882-1568 or dgileau@abrazohealth.com . An online volunteer form is available at AbrazoHealth.com .

""If not handled properly, fireworks can cause severe injuries to eyes and skin. Even just watching a friend light fireworks can put you at risk,'' said William Ellert, Market Chief Medical Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 10,000 firework-related injuries happened in 2014. Of these, 67 percent occurred in the 30 days surrounding July 4. In addition, children ages 5 to 9 years old experienced a higher injury rate than other age groups. It is incredibly important to make sure that children do not handle fireworks, Dr. Ellert said. Even fireworks sold at a grocery store, such as sparklers or other small novelties, are just as dangerous. Bottle rockets and sparklers, which can burn at more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, accounted for nearly 40 percent of all estimated injuries in 2013. While the best way to prevent these types of injuries is to leave the show to the experts, if you or a friend chooses to handle fireworks, the National Council on Firework Safety offers these tips: Use fireworks outdoors only. Obey local laws. If fireworks are not legal where you live, do not use them. Always have water handy. Only use fireworks as intended. Don't try to alter them or combine them. Use common sense. Spectators should keep a safe distance and wear safety glasses. Alcohol and fireworks do not mix. Have a ""designated shooter."" Do not use homemade fireworks. Report illegal explosives to the fire or police department in your community of all estimated injuries in 2013. For non-life threatening emergencies, Abrazo Community Health Network’s six hospitals and two free-standing Emergency Departments offer a free online service for patients which projects timetables to be seen by a doctor. This allows patients to wait at home rather than in the ER. Go to findERtime.com for more information.

        }); Home >> Our Locations >> Abrazo West Campus >> Our News >> Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year PHOENIX (Dec. 9, 2016) –You better watch out, you better not ask why but it’s time to get honest about this jolly old guy. Santa Claus is one of the most beloved and recognized figures in the world. Also well-known are his sometimes unhealthy habits and lifestyle – like his weight. Jolly old St. Nicholas, lean your ear this way. Abrazo Community Health Network has health advice to help keep you healthy throughout the New Year. 1. Overweight: Symptoms: Mid-section shakes like “bowlful of jelly” Concerns: Heart & vascular disease, obesity Recommendation: Santa Claus’s extra weight puts him at risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and stroke. Lay off the sweets, hit the gym and look into a weight loss program. 2. Bad Knees & Back: Cause: Slinging sacks of toys up and down chimneys, arthritis from age Recommendation: Enroll in a weight control programs and head to the gym. It might be time Santa looked in to a possible knee replacement. 3. Nose like a Cherry: Concerns: Could be a sign of eczema, rosacea, wind burn, sun burn or frost bite Recommendation: An annual skin cancer screening or a visit to the dermatologist is suggested. Check for allergies to reindeer, mistletoe and holly. Also, rosacea is often triggered by alcohol so lay off the spiked egg nog. 4. Infectious Diseases: Cause: Working in close proximity with under-the-weather elves and reindeer Recommendation: The best stay-well winter strategy is a flu shot. Keep the stables clean and wash hands often when working with animals. 5. Diabetes: Cause: Christmas cookie diet, obesity Recommendation: Try grabbing fresh fruit or share some carrot sticks with the reindeer instead of giving into the Christmas Eve cravings. Getting out for regular walks with Mrs. Clause will help Santa stay away from a sedentary life which can make diabetes worse. 6. Lung Cancer: Cause: Corn-cob pipe smoking, exposure to large amounts of chimney soot Recommendation: Stop smoking immediately.  Find alternative means of access to dwellings when delivering presents. 7. Snoring: Cause: Restless sleep due to worry over elf productivity in the workshop Recommendation: Take part in a sleep study to make sure snoring isn’t a result of sleep apnea. 8. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Cause: He makes lots of lists and he checks them twice Recommendation: Dictate text with speech-recognition software on your computer or talk to Siri on your iPhone to minimalize stress on hands and wrists. 9. Sleigh & Chimney Safety: Concerns: Wounds from constantly bumping into the sleigh, roof-tops and chimneys Recommendation: Chronic wounds can get worse when coupled with diabetes, circulatory problems and immobilization brought on by sitting in a sleigh for long periods. Infection control and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are some of the things that help with healing. 10. Psychological Problems: Manifestation: Unreasonably jolly all the time Indication: “North Polar Disorder” Recommendation: Immediate evaluation by a mental health professional If you, like Santa, need a healthcare provider, Abrazo Community Health Network’s affiliated general practitioners, cardiologists, bariatric surgeons, vascular surgeons, internists and orthopedic surgeons can help.  Call our Physician Referral Line at 1-877-934-9355 to find a physician.

For more than 10 years, we have been your community hospital, and with the recent opening of a Level 1 Trauma Center, Abrazo West Campus has transformed into a distinguished medical center. We have taken our Emergency Department to a state-designated T-1 level, which means EMTs can bring patients here instead of having to drive them to another hospital 25 minutes away,” says Tiffiny Strever, RN, Trauma Program Manager. “They are very excited about that, and so are the people who live in our community. Whether you need a heart health screening or orthopedic surgery, you’ll find expert clinical teams, advanced medical technology and attentive staff dedicated to making your stay safe and comfortable. My doctor told me there would be three little pencil-sized incisions and the robot goes in there and snip, snip, snip and you’re all done and you’ll heal faster, so I said, ‘Let’s do it. My mother had a hysterectomy several years ago and had a large incision and a lot of pain. I’m glad that I had a better option. Mary Brown was the first patient to have surgery with the da Vinci XI surgical platform at Abrazo West Campus in September 2014. 2014 Women’s Choice Award for Emergency Care Abrazo West Campus earned the 2014 Women’s Choice Award for Emergency Care, given to hospitals that show a strong commitment to patient satisfaction and good health outcomes, with an emphasis on the needs and preferences of women. It’s an honor and privilege to be recognized with The Women’s Choice award,” says CEO Stan Holm. “From the front line staff all the way up to our Board of Trustees, we have intentionally focused on improving the patient experience for women in our emergency department. We plan on continuing to advance our efforts in this endeavor. 13677 W. McDowell Rd.
