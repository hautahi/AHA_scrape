This national award recognizes nurses for the excellent care they provide to patients. The DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses nominations are made by patients and family members. Basler was nominated by a patient who wrote “Ronda truly shows great team work, leadership, integrity and innovation in her job as a nurse. She is definitely an outstanding role model for her coworkers, patients and this hospital.’’ She received the hospital’s DAISY Award at a celebration at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus where she has worked for more than two years. Basler’s passion for nursing comes from personal experience. During her first semester in nursing school, her father was involved in a motor vehicle accident that caused him to be a quadriplegic. ""I had already known I wanted to be a nurse by this time but the extent of my dad's health motivated me more dedicated because I wanted to be the nurse possible for him and others,’’ she said. Nomination forms for the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses are available at the hospital, 3929 E. Bell Road. The award will be presented each quarter. The DAISY Foundation was created in memory of J. Patrick Barnes after he passed away from an autoimmune disease. His family was so touched by the compassion and hope provided by the nurses who cared for him that they created the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses. The award honors nurses who provide excellent patient care while simultaneously providing extraordinary emotional support to patients and their families.

Learn More I woke up at 1:15 a.m. because I could not swallow and my face felt ‘funny.’ I went to the bathroom mirror and was shocked at how large my lips and neck were. I knew I was having an allergic reaction, but I had no idea to what. I took a Benadryl, but the swelling got worse, so we left for the ER. I was seen by Dr. Bryan Heidrich, who immediately recognized my condition as an anaphylactic reaction with angioedema brought on by Lisinopril. I wouldn’t be here today if not for his knowledge and immediate action. I had to be intubated. A nurse held my hand as I was put under general anesthesia. I can tell you that just the simple act of holding my hand and talking to me as they started this procedure was very comforting. I was really scared at this point and that small act of kindness made a huge difference to me. –Tiffany Goss, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus Urology When you have a urological condition, it can be painful and stressful to live with, and some have serious consequences.

	}); Five Fast Facts Do most people who have bariatric surgery regain their weight? About half of patients may regain about 5 percent of their weight within two years of their bariatric surgery. But most patients, given nutritional and behavioral help, maintain successful weight-loss long-term. Is bariatric surgery an “easy way out”? Absolutely not. Many morbidly obese Individuals have tried many times to follow diet and exercise plans only to learn that it’s easy to lose 10 to 20 lbs. but keeping it off is only successful in 1 to 2 percent of individuals.  The National Institutes of Health has determined that successful weight loss for patients with BMI of more than 35 may be impossible without surgical intervention. Will I ever be  able to drink coffee, tea or alcohol again, after bariatric surgery? Unless your bariatric doctor recommends that you don’t drink coffee, tea, or alcohol for other health reasons, there is no reason you shouldn’t be able to drink those things after bariatric surgery. However, we advise all patients to avoid all alcoholic beverages during the period of rapid weight loss. Will I have to take vitamins and minerals after bariatric surgery? Yes, a multivitamin will be needed. You may also need higher doses of certain vitamins or minerals, such as iron, calcium, and vitamin D. Do I need to lose weight before bariatric surgery? Yes. Patients are required to maintain a customized diet to start the weight loss process and understand their relationship with food. Preoperative weight loss can help shrink your liver and reduce your fat in the abdomen to lower your risk during bariatric surgery. Some insurance companies may require weight loss up to six months before surgery in order to qualify for bariatric surgery. Do you have more questions?

	}); .bannerK .sfimageWrp img{display:none;} Abrazo Scottsdale Campus What to Expect Once You’re Here Our community is growing, and with that comes a greater demand for medical care. Like most hospitals, we offer a broad range of services to meet your needs when you walk through our doors. Unlike other hospitals, we offer those services with the human touch that only a smaller community hospital can provide. That means less frustration for you. Linda Curry was driving her daughter home when she fell unconscious at the wheel without any warning signs. Linda didn’t have a pulse and was experiencing a full cardiac arrest. Read Linda's Story “Abrazo Scottsdale Campus is a small hospital so you get more personal attention,”
says Abrazo Scottsdale Campus volunteer Janet Zupet. “It’s a very comforting and transparent and warm place.” She’s not paid to say that. She sees it every day as a volunteer. Because it never hurts to be recognized for excellence, we were named a Top Performer on Key Quality Measures by The Joint Commission, a recognition of exemplary performance in using clinical processes that improve care. 3929 E.

The Scottsdale resident has been a registered nurse at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus for 30 years and she works in the Postpartum/Gynecology Unit. “It is very rewarding to be able to help people in their time of need,’’ Driscoll said. “My mother was a registered nurse and a wonderful role model. She inspired me to care for others.’’ DAISY Award nominations are made by patients and family members. In her nomination, the daughter of one of Driscoll’s patients wrote: “The simple acts of kindness that Amy constantly showed throughout our visit had such a huge impact on our experience. Never have we felt so welcome and so taken care of at any hospital. I was astonished by her never-ending compassion for not only my mom (the patient) but for anyone who came into the room.’’ Driscoll, BSN RNC has a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Stony Brook School of Nursing. What is her advice for nurses starting their careers? “Nursing can be a lot of hard work. Always remain passionate about what you do and remember why you became a nurse,’’ Driscoll said. Nomination forms for the DAISY Award are available at the hospital, 3929 E. Bell Road in Phoenix. The award will be presented quarterly. The DAISY Foundation was created in memory of J. Patrick Barnes after he passed away from an autoimmune disease. His family was so touched by the compassion and hope provided by the nurses who cared for him that they created the DAISY Award. The award honors nurses who provide excellent patient care while simultaneously providing extraordinary emotional support to patients and their families.

	}); Why Weight Loss Surgery? “I don’t like how I look but, really, I feel fine.” Sound familiar? Don’t be fooled into thinking you aren’t in danger. Carrying around an excess amount of weight can lead to complications that could be just around the corner. You might even be having them now, and not realize it. If you’re overweight and have struggled to lose weight and keep it off, there are many reasons to consider bariatric weight loss surgery. Perhaps diabetes was just something people in your family learned to accept. Break away from that thinking. Now is the time to fight against common health conditions like diabetes, heart disease and infertility. Now’s the time to gain confidence in yourself and take on new tasks. Health Complications Carrying  excessive weight can put you at risk for numerous health complications, including: Type 2 diabetes High blood pressure Heart problems Crippling arthritis Sleep apnea Reflux Chronic Headaches Shortening life span up to 14 years Problems with an Existing Lap Band Through Bariatric Revision Surgery, we are ready to help those having complications with an implanted gastric band. Doctors will meet with you to discuss removal of the weight loss device, and they may potentially suggest another form of bariatric surgery. Family History Maybe it’s time to stop the cycle of obesity in your family. If your mother or father (maybe both) suffered from obesity, you don’t have to continue to follow in their footsteps. Now’s the time to make a change to improve your health. Unable to Have Surgery Because of Weight Carrying an excessive amount of weight can also put you at a higher risk for some common surgical procedures. It may be hard or impossible to give you anesthesia. Doctors may have a hard time finding your veins or knowing how much medication you need. After surgery, your risk for complications can go way up because of your weight. You may have a greater chance of having a heart attack, having wounds heal properly, or developing nerve damage. It’s best to drop the pounds first, upping your chances of a successful operation. Infertility Obese women are nearly half as likely to become pregnant than women of normal weight. And even if you become pregnant, there can be a greater chance of losing the baby. Obese men can also have health problems that interfere with fertility. They may suffer from hormone irregularities that can limit sperm production. Self-Confidence Is weight and health affecting your self-image? Don’t let your weight get you down. Losing weight and getting healthier can help you gain confidence and lead to a healthier, more active and fulfilled life. Find a Bariatric Physician and Schedule a Consultation Take a risk assessment to find out if you are a candidate for surgical weight loss.

The donations were collected at nine Abrazo facilities as part of the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive which ended June 9. Abrazo West Campus and Abrazo Buckeye Emergency Center staff and community members donated cereal and Partners for Health donated $500 to Agua Fria Food Bank.  Abrazo Maryvale Campus staff and community members donated cereal to Maryvale Revitalization Corp. St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance received donations from staff and community members at Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital, Abrazo Arrowhead Campus, Abrazo Central Campus, Abrazo Community Health Network’s Regional Office, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus and Abrazo Peoria Emergency Center. When 11-year-old Brityn Hasl heard that Abrazo Arrowhead Campus was collecting cereal for hungry children, she decided to help.  The Peoria resident collected 110 boxes of cereal by making phone calls and posting a plea on her mother’s Facebook page. Her mother, Brannan Hasl, is an Abrazo Arrowhead Campus nurse. “I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to wonder when I would eat again. I was able to make sure quite a few kids would be able to have breakfast all summer,’’ said Brityn. The Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive’s purpose is to feed hungry children during the summer months when they don’t have access to school meals. ""At Abrazo Community Health Network, our goal is not only to help patients get well but also to help our community understand and take control of their health,"" said Market Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Ellert. ""Part of this includes recognizing the importance of good nutrition. Through this drive, we can help those who are struggling with food insecurity."" Arizona ranks third in the country for high child food insecurity rates, behind only New Mexico and Mississippi, with 456,760 children facing hunger on a daily basis, according to St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance. “We appreciate Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals for hosting the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive,’’ said Jerry Brown, director of public relations for St. Mary’s Food Bank Alliance.  “Summer is a particularly difficult time for our food bank because many children can no longer rely on their schools for meals so their families often turn to us for help. Thanks to Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals and the Healthy Over Hungry Cereal Drive, many families will have a healthy breakfast.’’ To make an even greater impact this year, Tenet Healthcare is matching all financial donations made as part of the cereal drives at Abrazo hospitals and other Tenet facilities nationally up to $100,000 collectively to provide perishable breakfast items such as milk, lean protein and fruit. For every $1 donation, five meals can be provided by food banks. Whole-grain cereal, when part of a healthy, balanced breakfast including dairy (such as milk and yogurt), fruit and lean protein, is a popular food item that experts say can easily address the hunger gap during the summer months when children are not in school. Healthy cereal contains one serving of whole grain, no more than 200 calories per serving, six grams or less of sugar and at least three grams of fiber per serving. It should also be free of artificial colors and dyes.

Heart disease remains the No. 1 killer of both men and women in the United States. More than 600,000 Americans die of heart disease each year. About 85.6 million Americans are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke, according to the American Heart Association. “Health education and disease prevention should be top priorities for patients and their caregivers. At Abrazo Community Health Network hospitals, we are deeply committed to helping patients and their loved ones understand the risks associated with heart disease so they can seize control of their health,’’ said Timothy Byrne, Market Medical Director for Cardiology for Abrazo Community Health Network The health screenings will be at the Abrazo booth at the Phoenix Heart Walk which will be held at CityScape, 318 W. Washington St. Cholesterol and glucose screenings will be provided from 8-11 a.m. and blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) checks will be available from 8 a.m. to noon. For glucose, please fast for six to eight hours prior to this test for accurate results. Healthcare professionals will be on hand to answer questions.  Stroke, heart disease, diabetes and other educational materials will be provided. Abrazo Community Health Network is the Phoenix Heart Walk’s Year-Round Cause sponsor. Hundreds of Abrazo Community Health Network employees will be participating in this year’s Phoenix Heart Walk. Last year, Abrazo was the top fundraising company with about $95,000 in donations.

	}); Nutritional Counseling We have a team of bariatric physicians (bariatricians) and medical weight loss specialists who will help you adapt to a new diet both before and after bariatric surgery. We will design a plan to help you avoid food intolerances and other nutritional considerations specific to your post-operative journey. Expect to be on liquid diet for 2 weeks after weight loss surgery. Over time, you’ll start to eat soft foods and then solid foods. If you eat too much or too fast, you may have abdominal pain or may vomit. In time, you will learn how to know when your new stomach is full. Your body will change and you will now need to develop good, healthy eating habits to adapt to that change.  Some advice we give is slow down! Here are a few tips to help you develop Mindful Eating. Set aside at least 30 to 45 minutes for your meal. Explain to your friends and family members that you can’t just rush through a meal. Take small bites, chewing each bite of your food 20 times. Look at what you eat; don’t just “fade out’’ while eating. Pay attention to how food tastes and smells. Learn to appreciate food, not see it as something that hurts you. Don’t over-indulge. When you’re full, stop eating. You’ll find you will get full much more quickly than before you had weight loss surgery. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Eat a variety of healthy foods. Make sure your diet includes lean protein. Take your doctor-recommended supplements . If you have any questions, please call our Program Coordinator at 1-877-934-9355 .

The session will be from 6-7:30 p.m. at the hospital’s first floor conference room, 3929 E. Bell Road in Phoenix. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm and may increase risk of stroke, heart failure and decrease quality of life.  During this presentation, participants will learn about how the management of A-fib has advanced greatly in the past few years. They will hear about the symptoms, long-term prognosis, and new treatments from medications to revolutionary hybrid surgical procedures.  They will also learn now to reduce their risk for stroke.  There will be a question-answer session. Complimentary refreshments will be served. A free hot/cold pack will be distributed to participants as supplies last.

""If not handled properly, fireworks can cause severe injuries to eyes and skin. Even just watching a friend light fireworks can put you at risk,'' said William Ellert, Market Chief Medical Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 10,000 firework-related injuries happened in 2014. Of these, 67 percent occurred in the 30 days surrounding July 4. In addition, children ages 5 to 9 years old experienced a higher injury rate than other age groups. It is incredibly important to make sure that children do not handle fireworks, Dr. Ellert said. Even fireworks sold at a grocery store, such as sparklers or other small novelties, are just as dangerous. Bottle rockets and sparklers, which can burn at more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, accounted for nearly 40 percent of all estimated injuries in 2013. While the best way to prevent these types of injuries is to leave the show to the experts, if you or a friend chooses to handle fireworks, the National Council on Firework Safety offers these tips: Use fireworks outdoors only. Obey local laws. If fireworks are not legal where you live, do not use them. Always have water handy. Only use fireworks as intended. Don't try to alter them or combine them. Use common sense. Spectators should keep a safe distance and wear safety glasses. Alcohol and fireworks do not mix. Have a ""designated shooter."" Do not use homemade fireworks. Report illegal explosives to the fire or police department in your community of all estimated injuries in 2013. For non-life threatening emergencies, Abrazo Community Health Network’s six hospitals and two free-standing Emergency Departments offer a free online service for patients which projects timetables to be seen by a doctor. This allows patients to wait at home rather than in the ER. Go to findERtime.com for more information.

She was honored at the March of Dimes Arizona chapter’s Nurse of the Year Awards Gala. S he has been a nurse in the telemetry unit at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus, 3929 E. Bell Road in Phoenix, since May 2015. Her family’s personal experience with terminal illness prompted her to become a nurse. “The nurses were there every day overflowing with compassion, empathy and guiding our family through the emotional process. My family was comforted and supported by the nurses who cared for us during our time of grief. After witnessing the strength and impact nurses had to not only heal patients but also their families, I knew that was my calling,’’ Foster said. Foster, 34, graduated from Grand Canyon University in April 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in nursing. She participated in Abrazo Community Health Network’s Nurse Residency Program. She also was an officer of the National Student Nurses Association. She was a guest speaker for the Arizona State University Nurse Association ceremony. Foster has leadership roles in nurse associations. She currently is chair-elect of the American Nurses Association’s Nomination and Elections Committee and she is working with the Arizona Nurses Association to create the Young Professional Nurse Chapter for new nurses within the first five years of practice. She also served on the Arizona Nurses Association’s Public Policy Committee and helped evaluate pending legislation relevant to nursing during the last legislative session. “Nursing is an amazing profession with some of the most giving, talented and intelligent people you will ever meet. As a nurse, you not only advocate for your patients but also for your peers and the profession. It is a privilege and an honor to be a nurse,’’ Foster said.

	}); How to Start Your Journey Once you have decided to pursue bariatric surgery, you may want to speed up the process. But there’s a benefit to taking a careful approach. The aim of the Abrazo Scottsdale Campus Bariatric Wellness Institute is to prepare you both physically and emotionally for your journey. As part of that process, you’ll undergo tests to determine whether you are a good candidate for weight loss surgery. Our Program Coordinator will help guide you throughout your journey. After your initial medical tests, your health factors will be evaluated. This involves some blood work and tests to monitor your heart, lungs and chest. As part of the comprehensive bariatric program, you will meet with a psychiatrist to determine your emotional readiness and help understand any barriers to your long-term success. You doctor will discuss the bariatric procedures with you to help determine the best option and review the benefits, risks and expectations of surgery. Before bariatric surgery, you may also need to: Lose some weight to help prevent problems during and after surgery Stop smoking Work with health care providers to treat medical or emotional problems Six consecutive monthly visits including: one visit with a regular dietician, one visit with a psychologist and certain medical tests. Each visit will review a different topic, such as: General health issues Nutritional food guidelines Weight loss, diet and exercise Cardiac clearance Pulmonary clearance Sleep study (if needed) One of your goals for each visit will be to show weight loss, which is necessary to meet guidelines for insurance plans. Surgery will be scheduled within two to four weeks after you meet the criteria for the procedure. If you have any questions, please call our Program Coordinator at 1-877-934-9355 . Find a Bariatric Physician and Schedule a Consultation Take a risk assessment to find out if you are a candidate for surgical weight loss.

	}); Behavior Modification Getting the weight off and keeping it off takes more than just having bariatric surgery. Weight loss surgery, coupled with improved nutrition, exercise and behavior modification, can lead to A Better You. Your mind and spirit play a big role in weight management. It’s important to know that your emotions can trigger eating. You will need to develop new, healthier habits. Here are some tips: Self-monitor what you’re doing. Keep track of what you eat and drink and how much physical activity you get. This will help increase self-awareness of your behavior. Increase your physical activity. Find joy in learning new activities. Learn to see food as a positive aspect of your life. You’re no longer eating just to be full or to help you feel better after a tough day. You’re eating to reap the benefits of fueling your body. Set realistic goals. Don’t expect to drop too much weight too quickly. Consider joining a support group or going to therapy to help deal with your new lifestyle. Keep your mind busy, eating typically happens due to boredom. Stop watching TV! Food commercials are designed to trigger your hunger centers even when you are not hungry. While watching TV, fast forward through the commercials. You are no longer living to eat. You are now eating to live! If you have any questions, please call our Program Coordinator at 1-877-934-9355 . Find A Location Why Weight Loss Surgery Is Weight Loss Surgery for Me?

Abrazo Community Health Network was the highest fundraiser among healthcare companies and was the second highest company fundraiser overall of about 130 companies participating in the 24 rd annual Phoenix Heart Walk which attracted 20,000 participants on March 18. More than 430 Abrazo employees were registered for the walk. “The participation from our Abrazo employees was amazing and inspiring,’’ said Frank Molinaro, Market Chief Executive Officer for Abrazo Community Health Network. “Through collaboration and compassion, we were able to raise more than $71,000 for such a great cause.” Abrazo Community Health Network is also the Phoenix Heart Walk’s year-round cause sponsor, the largest sponsorship of the 2017 Phoenix Heart Walk, and Abrazo Central Campus was the Stroke Mile sponsor. Tami Biggs, Abrazo Arizona Heart Hospital Chief Operating Officer, helped champion the 2017 Phoenix Heart Walk. “Our mission in our personal lives as well as our work lives is to champion exceptional healthcare to those whose lives we touch. I would like to thank everyone who participated this year whether at the hospital events, at the Phoenix Heart Walk or supporting one of our teams.’’  Biggs said.

	}); Exercise and Fitness Counseling Exercise Tips You might want to make sure your bariatric weight loss tool box has room for exercise. Even a little bit of activity can help you make great strides toward a better you! If your bariatric doctor gives you the go-ahead to exercise, create an exercise plan and get going. Just don’t overdo it! Don’t worry about having to join a gym if that’s not your thing. There are lots of exercises you can do at home or in your neighborhood without paying for a gym membership. How about starting out with walking? A game of catch with the kids or working around the house or out in the yard, can also raise your heart rate and help with your weight loss. Once you’ve gotten into an exercise routine, you may want to add weight-bearing activities to help build muscle tone. The more lean muscle you have, the easier it will be to continue to lose weight. Keep Track Keep a journal, and chart your progress. Team up with a friend to help keep you motivated and increase the fun. Set goals. Once you’ve hit your goal, set new ones. Get a Fit Bit pedometer or other tool to measure and keep a record of your steps. You’ll be surprised at how quickly they add up! Try to build up to 10,000 steps per day. Track your heart rate! It’s easier for bariatric patients to burn calories with less exercise. Your heart rate can keep you working in a fat burning zone to maximize your time. Exercise smarter not harder. Don’t think of exercise as a chore, but rather as something good you’re doing for yourself. It will help your body and your mind. Studies have shown that getting the blood pumping can help boost your mood! If you have any questions, please call our ​Program Coordinator at ​1-877-934-9355. Find a Bariatric Physician and Schedule a Consultation Take a risk assessment to find out if you are a candidate for surgical weight loss.

        }); Home >> Our Locations >> Abrazo Scottsdale Campus >> Our News >> Abrazo Scottsdale Campus seeks retirees to volunteer at hospital Abrazo Scottsdale Campus seeks retirees to volunteer at hospital PHOENIX (April 13, 2017) –   When Nancy Dorr retired from teaching, she knew she didn’t want to give up her favorite part — working with people. She decided Abrazo Scottsdale Campus was a great place to do that, something she knew from personal experience. “I had spent some time at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus as a patient — I’ve had outpatient surgery here, as has my husband, and it was great,” she says. “Plus I knew it was a small setting, so it wouldn’t be too overwhelming.” In honor of National Volunteer Month in April, Dorr is sharing her story to encourage others to volunteer at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus, 3929 E. Bell Road, which is seeking more retirees to donate their time and talents. Dorr, who recently was named Volunteer of the Quarter, started at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus in 2009. She floats wherever she is needed, and always puts her communication skills to good use. “I work in the recovery room and at the outpatient desk, so I see people both before and after their surgeries, and also their families,” she says. “I communicate between the nurses in the recovery room and the families who are waiting, which really helps everyone.” If you've ever had a loved one in the hospital, you know having a point person to keep you updated can give you back a sense of control, and lighten the burden you’re carrying. “The families really like having someone tell them what’s going on, and often the nurses are too busy to come out and provide that information,” Dorr says. The patients also notice that the people at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus go the extra mile. “I've had many patients come up to the desk on their way home to tell me what a wonderful experience they had,” she says. “Everyone here is focused on great communication and caring service from start to finish."" The bottom line for Dorr: She believes in the care she’s helping Abrazo Scottsdale Campus provide. “If people tell me they haven’t had good luck with their health care, I tell them to try us out. Good things happen here.” “Throughout the year, volunteers play a key role at Abrazo Scottsdale Campus helping out day to day and giving our patients a sense of community and a personal touch that lets them know their neighbors care,’’ said David Tupponce, Abrazo Scottsdale Campus Chief Executive officer. Volunteers can help patients by escorting them to their destinations and providing water and ice.  They also can perform clerical duties and help at the guest relation desks. Abrazo Scottsdale Campus, 3929 E. Bell Road, is a 136-bed full-service acute care hospital offers an accredited chest pain center, wound care and hyperbaric (high pressure) medicine, high-tech navigation system for orthopedic procedures, da Vinci robotic surgery, surgical weight loss, navigational technology, sports medicine, expanded rehabilitation services, enhanced diagnostic imaging and women’s programs.

        }); Home >> Our Locations >> Abrazo Scottsdale Campus >> Our News >> Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year Ho Ho Ho! Health advice to keep Santa and you healthy throughout the New Year PHOENIX (Dec. 9, 2016) –You better watch out, you better not ask why but it’s time to get honest about this jolly old guy. Santa Claus is one of the most beloved and recognized figures in the world. Also well-known are his sometimes unhealthy habits and lifestyle – like his weight. Jolly old St. Nicholas, lean your ear this way. Abrazo Community Health Network has health advice to help keep you healthy throughout the New Year. 1. Overweight: Symptoms: Mid-section shakes like “bowlful of jelly” Concerns: Heart & vascular disease, obesity Recommendation: Santa Claus’s extra weight puts him at risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and stroke. Lay off the sweets, hit the gym and look into a weight loss program. 2. Bad Knees & Back: Cause: Slinging sacks of toys up and down chimneys, arthritis from age Recommendation: Enroll in a weight control programs and head to the gym. It might be time Santa looked in to a possible knee replacement. 3. Nose like a Cherry: Concerns: Could be a sign of eczema, rosacea, wind burn, sun burn or frost bite Recommendation: An annual skin cancer screening or a visit to the dermatologist is suggested. Check for allergies to reindeer, mistletoe and holly. Also, rosacea is often triggered by alcohol so lay off the spiked egg nog. 4. Infectious Diseases: Cause: Working in close proximity with under-the-weather elves and reindeer Recommendation: The best stay-well winter strategy is a flu shot. Keep the stables clean and wash hands often when working with animals. 5. Diabetes: Cause: Christmas cookie diet, obesity Recommendation: Try grabbing fresh fruit or share some carrot sticks with the reindeer instead of giving into the Christmas Eve cravings. Getting out for regular walks with Mrs. Clause will help Santa stay away from a sedentary life which can make diabetes worse. 6. Lung Cancer: Cause: Corn-cob pipe smoking, exposure to large amounts of chimney soot Recommendation: Stop smoking immediately.  Find alternative means of access to dwellings when delivering presents. 7. Snoring: Cause: Restless sleep due to worry over elf productivity in the workshop Recommendation: Take part in a sleep study to make sure snoring isn’t a result of sleep apnea. 8. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Cause: He makes lots of lists and he checks them twice Recommendation: Dictate text with speech-recognition software on your computer or talk to Siri on your iPhone to minimalize stress on hands and wrists. 9. Sleigh & Chimney Safety: Concerns: Wounds from constantly bumping into the sleigh, roof-tops and chimneys Recommendation: Chronic wounds can get worse when coupled with diabetes, circulatory problems and immobilization brought on by sitting in a sleigh for long periods. Infection control and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are some of the things that help with healing. 10. Psychological Problems: Manifestation: Unreasonably jolly all the time Indication: “North Polar Disorder” Recommendation: Immediate evaluation by a mental health professional If you, like Santa, need a healthcare provider, Abrazo Community Health Network’s affiliated general practitioners, cardiologists, bariatric surgeons, vascular surgeons, internists and orthopedic surgeons can help.  Call our Physician Referral Line at 1-877-934-9355 to find a physician.

	}); Bariatric Surgery The Abrazo Scottsdale Campus Bariatric Wellness Institute offers ​several types of bariatric surgery. There are advantages and disadvantages of each type. Your medical team will review each procedure to help determine the best method for ​you. Here’s a short description of each bariatric procedure. Bariatric Gastric Bypass Also called a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass​ surgery This surgery reduces the amount of food you can eat at one time. It also reduces the number of calories and nutrients you can absorb from the foods you eat. During bariatric gastric bypass surgery, your bariatric surgeon separates part of the stomach to create a small pouch. The pouch is then attached to a part of your small intestine. This small pouch holds less food, making you feel full faster. As food bypasses the rest of the stomach and upper part of your small intestine, you absorb fewer calories and nutrients. Advantages: Tends to be a very successful bariatric surgery Can lead to loss of about two-thirds of ​your excess body weight after 2 years Disadvantages: There's an increased risk of complications More likely to lead to nutritional problems with vitamin B12, folate and iron Can cause dumping syndrome Bariatric Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) This is a less common type of weight loss surgery. In this procedure, your bariatric surgeon removes part of the stomach to create a gastric sleeve, as with the sleeve gastrectomy. The sleeve is then attached to a part of the lower small intestine.  The sleeve holds much less food than the normal stomach, and your body absorbs far fewer calories and nutrients from food. Advantages: Most helpful for a person who is extremely obese An option for people who haven’t had much success with a previous weight loss surgery Tends to lead to the highest amount of weight loss Disadvantages: Carries a higher risk for complications than other weight loss surgeries Reduces the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals Puts patients at a high risk for deficiencies of calcium, iron, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) Puts patients at high risk for developing protein-energy malnutrition Bariatric Sleeve Gastrectomy This is a type of weight loss surgery that removes up to two-thirds of the stomach. It’s also known as a gastric sleeve surgery. The surgery turns the stomach into a narrow tube that looks like a sleeve. The sleeve holds 8 oz. of food at a time, and you feel full faster. Your stomach will make less of the main hormone responsible for hunger. Advantages: Less complex than a gastric bypass Tends to have fewer complications than gastric bypass Can be better at controlling hunger than lap banding Can lead to loss of about two-thirds of your excess weight Reduced risk of dumping syndrome Disadvantages: Can cause or worsen existing reflux Bariatric Revision Surgery If you’ve had complications from a gastric band or ring or from a previous bariatric procedure, please feel free to contact the Abrazo Scottsdale Campus Bariatric Wellness Institute. The medical team can meet with you to discuss bariatric revision surgery. Find A Location Why Weight Loss Surgery Is Weight Loss Surgery for Me?
