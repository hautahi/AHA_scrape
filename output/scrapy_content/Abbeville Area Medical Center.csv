After Hours Care... Our after hours and weekend call is provided by our staff physicians who are at home with their families.

Should you have a true medical emergency, please call 911 instead. We will be able to advise you whether you should seek ER care or wait until the office is open again. We will also be able to help you if you have a question about over the counter medications or dosing. We ask that if you have questions about scheduling appointments or chronic medical conditions or issues you have seen the doctor for that you speak with our office during normal business hours. The best solution for this may be to make an appointment to discuss any issues. Regular medication refills should be requested during normal business hours. In order for your Provider to review your request and ensure that you have your medications in a timely manner, we ask that you call for these refills 3 business days prior to running out of your medication. ABSOLUTELY no pain or controlled medications will be refilled after hours. A request for an antibiotic after hours may not be granted.

Whether you’re a patient’s friend or family member, it’s our goal to offer the help you need to make your visit with us the best it can be. Please visit the links at the left to learn more about what to expect when you visit our hospital. Visiting Hours At AAMC, we understand how important being surrounded by family & friends is to the healing process. However, to make sure our patients get the rest and care they need, we ask our visitors to follow the guidelines listed below: Limit the number of visitors to two at a time Keep visits short Visitors must be at least 12 years old. Occasionally a nurse may ask you to shorten your visit or to leave the room briefly. Please understand that this is for the patient’s benefit & allows us time to provide necessary care. General: 8:00 am-8:00 pm Intensive Care Unit: 8:00 am-8:00 pm for 15 minutes every two hours* *Children over age 10 may visit with staff permission Visitor Tips We know that patients look forward to having visitors while they are in the hospital. Here are some visiting tips that will help make your loved one’s stay at AAMC easier: Make sure the person you’re at AAMC to see isn’t too ill to receive visitors. It may be better to send a card, flowers or balloons. If you are sick, please do not come for a visit. Knock before entering the patient’s room to make sure they’re not asleep or getting dressed or a physician or nurse is with them providing care. Be sure to check for any restrictions the patient may have before bringing a gift, especially food. Don’t talk about the experiences or problems of other people who have had the same health problem. Share positive thoughts. If a physician or nurse comes into the room during your visit, ask them if you need to leave for a few minutes while they care for the patient. Your loved-one is in the hospital to get well! Please keep your visiting time to a length that is comfortable for the patient.

Four South Carolina hospitals were recognized, with AAMC holding the top honor with a score of 91 percent.  Other hospitals recognized were Patewood Memorial Hospital in Greenville, Newberry County Hospital in Newberry and Cannon Memorial Hospital in Pickens. “Our nurses truly care about our patients and their families,” stated Charlotte Campbell, AAMC Inpatient Nursing Director.  “They strive to provide one-on-one care and our patients see that we are there for them every step of the way.  It’s not just a job to them, it’s a very heartfelt calling, and it shows.” At least 85 percent of patients at the four hospitals responded on their HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) surveys that nurses always communicated well. In South Carolina, the average score is 81 percent, slightly higher than the national average of 80 percent.  The figures are from CMS' Hospital Compare website and represent HCAHPS scores collected from April 2015 through March 2016, the most recent data available.  HCAHPS surveys measure patients' perspectives on hospital care. “Nurses are the backbone of any healthcare system – without good nurses we would not be able to provide the quality compassionate care for which we’ve become known,” stated Howard “Dean” Turner, AAMC CEO.  “We are very proud of our nurses and the genuine commitment they show to their patients and to our hospital.” CAPTION:  Members of the AAMC nursing staff were recently recognized as having the best “nurse-patient communication” in the state. Nurses, physicians, rehab services and other clinical staff work closely together to ensure patients receive the best care possible.

At Abbeville Area Medical Center, we take great pride in providing excellent care in a safe environment. If you have a concern about your bill, contact our Business Office at 864-366-3238. If you have a concern about your safety while you are in the hospital contact our Safety Officer at 864-366-3378. If you have a concern about the privacy of your health information, please contact our Privacy Officer at 864-366-3313. An opportunity to ask questions and express concerns. For many concerns, it’s usually best to first speak with the people caring for you. This would probably be your nurse, hospital case manager, or office staff.  If you don't feel that they are helping you, please contact our patient advocate at ext. 3279. They will then talk with others, including the head nurse, physicians or other staff caring for you. If you still are unsatisfied with the resolve to your concern, you may file a grievance with the hospital. The hospital will review, investigate and resolve the grievance in a reasonable amount of time-generally 7-10 days from the time it is received. The hospital will respond to you in writing, in an easy to understand manner. The letter should tell you the steps that have been taken on your behalf to investigate the grievance, the results, and a contact person. You, or the hospital personnel, may also want to meet in person to talk about what happened. AAMC contact person for grievances: Mary Margaret Jackson, 864-366-3279 PO Box 887 Abbeville, SC 29620 A grievance is considered closed when you are satisfied with the actions taken by the hospital. There may be times, however, when the hospital feels it has taken reasonable steps to address your concern, but you are still unsatisfied. That's when you may consider filing your concern with a hospital oversight organization-the next step below. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) licenses and certifies South Carolina hospitals. This means that the hospitals must meet certain rules and regulations in order to care for patients and receive payment. One function of DHEC is to investigate complaints about any facility they license. Submitting the complaint: You can file a complaint with the DHEC Bureau of Certification by phone, e-mail or fax: 800-922-6735 (voicemail available) Fax: 803-545-4292 E-mail: rushrf@dhec.sc.gov Mail to: SCDHEC Bureau of Certification/Health Regulation 2600 Bull St. Columbia, SC 29201 Medicare: If Medicare (federal health insurance program for people over age 65 or people under 65 who are disabled) pays for you or your loved one's care, you may have an additional place to go with a quality of care concern. Medicare pays a Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) in each state to oversee the quality of care provided to Medicare patients. In South Carolina, that organization is called the Carolinas Center for Medical Excellence (CCME). You can call CCME at the following number: 800-922-3089. Explain to the person who answers the phone what your concerns are. Depending on the type of problem you are having, they may be able to help right away. For example, with your permission, they may be able to call the hospital to see if they can help solve your problem. In other cases, they may ask you to send your complaint in writing using a complaint form.

treatment you would want should your doctor determine that you are
permanently unconscious or terminally ill with short life expectancy. Frequently Asked Questions about Living Wills: Is a “Living Will” the same as a “Last Will and Testament?” No. Your Last Will and Testament is a separate document that tells your
loved ones what to do with your property and resources after your death.
A Living Will gives direction about life support treatment – the
treatment you want and when you want it stopped. Where can I get a living will form in South Carolina? The living will form most commonly used in South Carolina is called a
""Declaration of a Desire for a Natural Death."" You can request one from
the following organizations or from the hospital’s Case Manager. SC
Commission on Aging                        803-735-0210 Joint Legislative Commission on Aging      803-734-2995 Governor's Office, Ombudsman Division    803-734-0457 When would my living will take effect? It would become effective when two doctors determine that you are
permanently unconscious or that your death will occur in a short period
of time. In South Carolina, ""permanently unconscious"" means that you are
in a permanent vegetative state in which your body continues to
function but your mind does not. This is different from a coma, because a
person in a coma usually wakes up, while a permanently unconscious
person will not. What are the requirements for signing a living will? You must be at least 18 years old, and you must be competent. At least
two persons and a notary public must act as witnesses when you sign the
document. If you sign a living will while you are a patient in a
hospital or a resident in a nursing home, a representative from the
Governor's Office called an ombudsman must be called and be present when
you sign. What else should I know about completing the living will form? You should be sure to state on the form whether you want tube feeding.
If you would like to, you can name someone who can revoke or enforce
your living will. What if I am pregnant? South Carolina law provides that your living will is not effective while you are pregnant. What if I change my mind after I have signed a living will? You may revoke a living will at any time while you are competent. There
are five simple ways to do so, all of which are explained on the living
will form. You must also tell your doctor that you have revoked your
living will. Should I consider signing both a healthcare power of attorney and a living will? Yes, because each document has advantages that are not available from
the other. A healthcare power of attorney allows the person of your
choice to decide, after considering all of the facts, what you would
want under the circumstances. If I do not have a healthcare power of attorney or a living will, who will make healthcare decisions for me? If you are unable to make healthcare decisions, South Carolina law
chooses persons who can make those decisions for you, or the courts may
be called upon to make the decisions or to appoint someone else to make
them. If you want to be sure the person who makes decisions for you is
familiar with your wishes, you should appoint an agent in a healthcare
power of attorney. Are healthcare power of attorneys and living wills that were signed in another state valid in South Carolina? If you have signed a healthcare power of attorney in another state, you
should have it reviewed by a lawyer to be sure it is valid in South
Carolina. A living will that is valid in another state will probably be
accepted in South Carolina. To be safe though, you should sign the
living will form approved by the South Carolina legislature. What if I have an old living will? On June 21, 1991, South Carolina adopted a new living will form. If you
signed a living will in South Carolina prior to June 12, 1991, it is
still valid. However, the old form does not say anything about permanent
unconsciousness and does not allow tube feeding to be withheld in most
situations. If you signed a living will in South Carolina prior to June 12, 1991, you should consider signing a new living will form.

If you want to name someone to make healthcare decisions for you, you should sign a healthcare power of attorney no matter what other documents you have. Frequently asked questions about a Healthcare Power of Attorney: How is a healthcare power of attorney different from a normal power of attorney? A healthcare power of attorney is a document in which you give another person (your agent) the power to make decisions related to your care. A normal power of attorney gives a person the power to make decisions about your money, property or business transactions. A normal power of attorney, however, will not necessarily allow your agent to make healthcare decisions for you. If you want an agent to be able to make healthcare decisions for you, you should sign a healthcare power of attorney no matter what other documents you may have. If you want an agent to make decisions about money, you will need a different power of attorney. Whom should I appoint as my agent? What if my agent cannot serve? You should appoint a person you trust and who knows how you feel about healthcare. You should also name an alternate in case your agent is unwilling or unable to serve. You should talk to the persons you choose as your agent and alternate to be sure they are willing to serve, and so that they know how you feel about healthcare. Why should I sign a healthcare power of attorney? You may become unable to make healthcare decisions for yourself. You can name the person who will make these decisions for you by signing a healthcare power of attorney. Through this person, you can make sure you continue to control your own healthcare. Without such a document, the courts may be called upon to make the decisions or to appoint another person to make them. What can I authorize an agent to do for me in a healthcare power of attorney? You can authorize your agent to make healthcare decisions for you in case you become unable to make decisions for yourself. In your healthcare power of attorney, you may tell your agent that you do or do not want blood transfusions, life support, CPR, feeding tubes, dialysis, etc. What are the requirements for signing a healthcare power of attorney? At least two persons must sign the document as witnesses when you sign it. Only one hospital employee can serve as a witness. Information is listed on the document about who can or cannot serve as a witness. You do not have to record your healthcare power of attorney for it to be valid. What if I change my mind? You can revoke your healthcare power of attorney at any time while you are competent by informing your agent or doctor that you have changed your mind. Where should I keep my healthcare power of attorney? Keep the original in a safe place where your family members can get it. You should also give a copy to as many of the following persons you are comfortable with: family members, physician, attorney, minister, priest or clergyman, agent. Do not put your only copy of these documents in your safe deposit box. Should I consider signing both a healthcare power of attorney and a living will? Yes, because each document has advantages that are not available from the other. A healthcare power of attorney allows the person or agent of your choice to decide, after considering all of the facts, what you would want under the circumstances. If I do not have a healthcare power of attorney or a living will, who will make healthcare decisions for me? If you are unable to make healthcare decisions, South Carolina law chooses persons who can make those decisions for you, or the courts may be called upon to make the decisions or to appoint someone else to make them. If you want to be sure the person who makes decisions for you is familiar with your wishes, you should appoint an agent in a healthcare power of attorney. Are healthcare power of attorneys and living wills that were signed in another state valid in South Carolina? If you have signed a healthcare power of attorney in another state, you should have it reviewed by a lawyer to be sure it is valid in South Carolina. A living will that is valid in another state will probably be accepted in South Carolina. To be safe though, you should sign the living will form approved by the South Carolina legislature. What if I have an old healthcare power of attorney? In May, 1992, South Carolina approved a standard healthcare power of attorney form. If you filled out your healthcare power of attorney form before that date, you may want to sign the revised form which has a few small changes.

Advance directives are documents that allow you to state the medical care you would or would not like to receive “in advance” should you become unable to make decisions for yourself. There are two types of legal documents – Living Will and Healthcare Power of Attorney. A Living Will is a document that states your wishes about what medical treatment you would want should your doctor determine that you are permanently unconscious or terminally ill with short life expectancy. Your will is a separate document that tells your survivors what to do with your property and resources after your death. Click here for more information about Living Wills . A Healthcare Power of Attorney is a document that allows you to name another person to make decisions about your care if you become temporarily or permanently unable to make decisions for yourself. If you want to name someone to make healthcare decisions for you, you should sign a healthcare power of attorney no matter what other documents you have. Click here for more information about Healthcare Power of Attorney . Contact the Case Management Department at 864-366-3264 for additional information.

Case managers work with physicians, nurses and community resources to find care options that are acceptable to the patient and family. Patients and/or families will be seen by a case manager when they are admitted to the hospital to make sure the patient will receive the proper level of care for their condition. The case manager also reviews charts daily for any changes in the patient’s condition or needs and shares this information with others involved in his/her care. Family members often have questions about the options available to their loved one when he/she leaves the hospital. Case managers have information about a variety of community resources and can tell the family how the patient may benefit from them. If you have questions about case management, contact their office at 864-366-3264.

Wounds that are not healing can cause severe health risks and may result in life-threatening infections, possible amputation and debilitating health problems. Types of wounds treated at our Center include: Ulcers Wound and bone infections Surgical wounds Diabetic wounds Tissue damage from radiation therapy Traumatic wounds Crush injuries Gangrene Brown recluse spider bites Edema (Swelling) Skin grafts With the treatment now available AAMC’s new Wound Care Center, people with slow-healing wounds no longer have to suffer. Our comprehensive approach can heal wounds that have resisted other treatments, and help you avoid loss of limbs, reduce incidence of recurrence, and get your life back. Our Center features a hyperbaric chamber where we offer hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This therapy uses a pressurized, see-through chamber to deliver high concentrations of oxygen to the bloodstream. While in the chamber, the patient can comfortably recline, listen to music or even watch television. When the chamber is pressurized, the patient breathes 100 percent pure oxygen, which saturates the patient’s blood plasma with oxygen, carrying 20 to 30 times the normal amount of oxygen to body tissues. Oxygen-saturated blood helps heal wounds and is effective in fighting certain types of infection. Oxygen therapy also stimulates the growth of new blood vessels and improves circulation. Are You a Candidate? If you suffer from a chronic or non-healing wound, speak with your physician about AAMC’s Wound and Hyperbaric Medicine Center. If you are a candidate, we will work with you and your doctor to deliver: Advanced therapies Proven clinical protocols An individualized, comprehensive plan of care that brings you the most appropriate and effective treatments for your particular needs Assessment and ongoing care by our wound care specialists Thorough training for you and your family on caring for the wound at home Education materials and resources related to prevention, nutrition, hygiene and other key topics for you and your family Ongoing communication so that you and your doctor stay informed and up-to-date on all aspects of your healing. Frequently Asked Questions How Do I Get Help from the Wound Care Center? You may call the Wound and Hyperbaric Medicine Center directly or be referred by your doctor. To make an appointment, call: (864) 366-3283. Does This Mean I Have to Change Doctors? Not at all. We work with your personal physician in the same way as we would any medical specialist. We keep your doctor informed on all aspects of your treatment with frequent progress reports. While you’ll be receiving treatment here for your wound, you’ll continue to receive all of your routine care from your physician. At the Center, you will be cared for by a physician who is specially trained in advanced wound healing techniques. Does Insurance Cover Treatment? Many health plans cover wound care treatments. We can help you determine what your specific plan covers. What Can I Expect at the First Appointment? The first appointment consists of an in-depth assessment by our wound care team, a review of your medical history, blood tests or additional tests if needed, and recommendations for your treatment plan. Please bring your medical records, insurance card, a list of all medications you are taking, and a list of allergies you may have to the first appointment. Expect to spend a few hours at the Center. What Causes Non-Healing Wounds? Chronic and non-healing wounds can result from a number of factors, including diabetes, poor circulation, trauma, vascular disease, and immobility (which can lead to pressure ulcers, commonly known as bed sores). People with diabetes are at particular risk. If you have a wound that won’t heal, you are not alone. Approximately 3 million to 5 million Americans experience this condition. The good news is that you no longer have to suffer. We not only use some of the most advanced therapies available for healing, but also address the underlying cause of the wound—for example, nutrition, lack of exercise, hygiene, ill-fitting shoes—to help eliminate recurrence. If you have additional questions or wish to schedule an appointment, call (864) 366-3283.

Our Business Office Staff is available from 8:30am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday to answer your questions and concerns and to provide a convenient location for paying bills in person. If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to call. If you would like a copy of your bill, we’ll be happy to send you one. We will return phone messages within 24 hours. To Pay Your Bill Online: Click here Billing Inquiry Phone Number: (864) 366-5011 Please send billing inquiries to the address below Abbeville Area Medical Center Post Office Box 887 Abbeville, South Carolina 29620 Please send payments to the following address: Abbeville Area Medical Center Post Office Box 887 Abbeville, South Carolina 29620 Billing… It’s always a good idea to make sure that you know the terms of your insurance coverage. This will help you understand the hospital's billing procedures and charges. If we have a question about your insurance coverage, a Financial Counselor will contact you or a member of your family while you are here if information is needed to process your claims. If You Have Health Insurance… We will need a copy of your identification card. We may also need the insurance forms, which are supplied by your employer or the insurance company. You will be asked to assign benefits from the insurance company directly to the hospital. Your plan may have special requirements, such as a second surgical opinion or pre-certification for certain tests or procedures. It is your responsibility to make sure the requirements of your plan have been met. If your plan's requirements are not followed, you may be financially responsible for all or part of the services rendered in the hospital. Some physician specialists may not participate in your healthcare plan and their services may not be covered. Our staff will file a claim with your insurance company as soon as possible following your discharge. Follow-up will begin 30-days after the claim is submitted. We will give all necessary information to your insurance company so that they can decide whether or not they will pay for your claim. You will be expected to make full payment of the account balance if insurance fails to pay timely or denies payment, and of your self-pay portion. If You Are Covered by Medicare… We will need a copy of your Medicare card to verify eligibility and process your Medicare claim. You should be aware that the Medicare program specifically will not pay for certain items and services, such as cosmetic surgery, routine services, and personal comfort items. Certain outpatient diagnostic tests are only covered by Medicare when the ordering physician reason for the test meets Medicare's definition of medical necessity. Deductibles and co-payments also are the responsibility of the patient. If You Are Covered by Medicaid… We will need a copy of your Medicaid card. Medicaid also will not pay for certain services. Please contact your case manager for specifics about the services for which Medicaid will and will not pay. If you have applied for Medicaid, you will need to sign a “promissory note” or a “patient financial information” letter that states you will pay your bill should your card not be approved. Please inform the hospital of the date you applied for Medicaid. Your Hospital Bill… The hospital will submit bills to your insurance company and will do everything possible to speed the processing of your claim. However, you should remember that your policy is a contract between you and your insurance company and you have the final responsibility for payment of your bill. We have several payment options available to assist you in paying your bill. Your bill reflects all of the services you receive during any hospital stay or for any outpatient services. You may have certain tests or treatments in the hospital, and may receive a bill from physicians you did not see in person. These bills are for the professional services these doctors performed while you were a patient – i.e.: diagnosis of your problem and interpretation of your test results. If You Have No Insurance… If you do not have insurance, you will be expected to make payment or payment arrangements through the Business Office prior to registration unless the treatment is an emergency. You will need to sign a “promissory note” or a “patient financial information” letter that states you will pay your bill should your card not be approved. Otherwise, your registration may be postponed in cooperation with your physician. At Abbeville Area Medical Center, a financial counselor is on staff to confidentially discuss payment arrangements with you or a member of your family. We accept cash, check, or credit card including Mastercard, Visa, Discover, or American Express. We will assist you in applying for Medicaid and Charity Care. Workers Compensation/Auto Accidents… Claims made for auto accidents or accidents at work can be accepted and billed only if the company or the insurance carrier guarantees payment. If a lawsuit is pending, the patient must assume the financial responsibility and make payment to the hospital prior to the settlement of the case.

The program has been developed to enable patients to stay in the hospital setting while receiving a more intense level of rehabilitative care. A qualifying patient is a person who has had a three or more day stay in a hospital during the past 30 days. Admission also requires a physician referral and the recommendation of a multidisciplinary team that includes the patient’s family, physician, case manager, therapists and nursing staff. Patients from other hospitals are eligible for admission into the program as well. This gives patients the added benefit of receiving care near family, friends and other local support. Treated conditions While every patient’s care is unique to his/her situation and health status, some examples of conditions we treat include: Orthopedic injuries, including joint repair or replacement Wounds that are not healing well Major surgery Intravenous (IV) therapy Management of congestive heart failure, cancer or other chronic health conditions Respiratory problems Stroke/cerebral vascular accident During your stay our skilled, compassionate staff will create treatment plans based on best-practice standards, as well as the specific needs of patients and their family members. Ultimately, our goal is to help you heal and build strength, so you can gain independence and get back to your life. During your short stay, you will be encouraged to wear your own clothing and bring photos or mementos from home. When you’re not receiving medical treatment, you are welcome to visit with friends & family, participate in activities or simply rest. Physical & occupational therapists will work with you and your family in setting short & long term goals. Appropriate equipment will be made available to suit your individual needs. Each patient makes progress based on individual medical needs and rehabilitative potential. The multidisciplinary team will continuously monitor your progress and evaluate new goals until they determine you are ready for discharge. You may be referred to home health or outpatient rehabilitative services for additional therapies to help your long term recovery goals. We encourage family and friends to visit you while you are in the hospital for your rehab. Regular visiting hours are from 8:00am - 8:00pm. Payment Medicare and most private insurance plans are accepted. If you need more information or have questions about the Inpatient Rehabilitation program please contact us at (864) 366-3264.

To make sure you stay safe during your hospital stay, there are certain guidelines we as you to follow. Click on the selections below to find out more about things you need to know during your stay here. Medication and Food from Home Getting Around Valuables Smoking Nurse-Call System During the night Leaving the unit Telephones Televisions Hospital beds Your identification bracelet Universal Infection Control Precautions Mail Notary Public Access to Your Medical Records Medication and Food from Home All medications required during your stay will be ordered by your physician and supplied by the hospital pharmacy. Using medications not prescribed by your physician may upset a carefully planned program of treatment and could be very harmful to you. Unless ordered by your doctor, we ask that you use no medications brought from home. Please do not bring food from home, unless approved by your doctor. Food storage facilities are not available, and it may interfere with your diet prescription. Back to the Top of Page Getting Around Please notify the nursing staff of your whereabouts at all times. Your doctor will give you and your nurse instructions about time out of bed, walking, use of wheelchair, etc. Check with your doctor or nurse before taking a tub bath or shower. Please do not attempt to get in and out of a wheelchair by yourself. To avoid injury, ask for help. Back to the Top of Page Valuables Please leave all jewelry, money (except for small change) and other valuables at home. If you do have valuable items with you, including medications, you will be asked to seal them in a special envelope which will be kept in a locked location. A receipt for the contents will be placed with your chart. At the time of your discharge, you may obtain your valuables by presenting your receipt to your nurse. Please remember that you are responsible for your dentures, eye glasses, hearing aids and prosthesis. The hospital cannot assume responsibility for your valuables or personal articles kept in your room or on your person. Back to the Top of Page Smoke-Free Environment As a leading healthcare institution, AAMC is concerned not only with the treatment of disease, but also the promotion of wellness. As a result, smoking by patients, employees or visitors is not permitted anywhere in the hospital or on the hospital grounds or in the parking lot. If you or your family member wishes to smoke, they must leave the hospital grounds. Back to the Top of Page Nurse-Call System Calling your nurse is as easy as pushing a button on the hand-held speaker or the bed-rail. When the button is pressed, a light will signal the nursing staff that you need assistance and your nurse or another nursing staff member will answer the call as promptly as possible. A call button is also available in the bathroom. You may request a hotel bell call system designed for persons that have disabilities or may have trouble using the traditional call button. Back to the Top of Page During the night Please stay in bed after you have been prepared for the night. Strange surroundings and sleeping medication may create a hazard for you if you get out of bed. For assistance during the night, use the call button. Back to the Top of Page Leaving the unit If you want to leave the unit, please check first at the nurses' station to make sure your doctor has given approval and to let the staff know where you can be reached. It is important to stay in your room until your doctor has made rounds and daily treatments have been completed. Back to the Top of Page Telephones Each room is furnished with a telephone. For local calls, dial the ten-digit local number. To call another room inside the AAMC system, simply dial three and the room number. For long distance calls, dial 0 for an operator for help to place the call. Long distance calls can be billed to your home telephone number or a telephone credit card, or may be placed as collect calls. Hearing impaired patients may request special telephones with volume adjustable handsets and red flashing light to signal an incoming call. Back to the Top of Page Televisions Each room is equipped with a television set. The network television channels and patient education channels are available free of charge. Back to the Top of Page Hospital beds Hospital beds are electrically operated, and the nurse will show you how to work the bed properly. The hospital bed is probably higher and narrower than your bed at home. Bedside rails are for your protection. They will be raised at night or during the day if you're resting, recovering from surgery or taking certain medications. Back to the Top of Page Your identification bracelet When your admission interview is completed, an identification bracelet will be placed on your wrist. It is important that you have this bracelet on your wrist at all times during your hospital stay. It is our way of identifying you if you are asleep, under anesthesia or in treatment. If your bracelet is removed, please let your nurse know. Another will be made for you. Back to the Top of Page Universal Infection Control Precautions Universal Infection Control Precautions are observed at AAMC to prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases. This means our healthcare professionals may wear gloves, eye goggles, or scrubs when caring for you or when handling soiled objects. If you have any questions about Universal Precautions, please ask your nurse. Back to the Top of Page Mail Any mail addressed to you at the hospital will be delivered to your room during afternoons by hospital volunteers.

Helen Whitlock is an active 84 year old woman who enjoys gardening, playing bridge, sewing, interior design and spending time with her little dog, Lily.  You’d never know that she suffers from congestive heart failure and has to have fluid ‘drained’ from her body regularly. In May, Mrs. Whitlock had been feeling extremely sick for several days.  She couldn’t eat, move or sleep. After numerous tests failed to find the cause, she said to herself, “I guess I’m just going to die.” On the advice of a friend, her daughter took her to AAMC.  After one blood test they knew exactly what was making her so sick.  She was immediately admitted and had 11 pounds of toxic fluid drained from her body.  Almost instantly she felt better and said thought she could have walked home, she felt so great. “Abbeville Area Medical Center saved my life,” said Mrs. Whitlock.  “I was so impressed with the whole staff.  The doctors were wonderful and so down to earth.” The doctors at AAMC prescribed a new medication for her and she’s feeling great. She hasn’t had to go back to the ER since her visit in May. “I will always go to AAMC from now on,” she said.
